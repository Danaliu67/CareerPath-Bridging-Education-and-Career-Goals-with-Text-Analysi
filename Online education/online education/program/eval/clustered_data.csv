This course approaches the tools provided by game engines as an experimental sound studio capable of creating new kinds of digital audio works for un-fixed media. Procedural audio tools can lead to endlessly evolving sound compositions and generative music; interactivity can empower navigability through sonic worlds, virtual sound installations, or the creation of new instruments; physics simulations can allow for real, hyperreal, and unreal audio environments for listeners, viewers, and gamers. Starting from the first day with the download of a game engine and a digital audio workstation and ending on the last with the critique of a sound-focused work, this class will provide a thorough introduction to authoring sound-focused art experiences using game engines. Some of the scholars/artists we will study in this course include Janet Cardiff & George Bures Millers audio walks, Peter Gena, Poppy Crum, Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers among others. Of particular interest are works that explore the use of real time, interactive, and emergent systems that critically address the ways that sound, action, and presence shape the experience of listening bodies. Screening may include virtual reality works such as Notes on Blindness by Colinart, La Burthe, and Middleton and Spinney or spatial audio experiences such as Scott Reithemans Boom App. Through weekly assignments and class studio time, we will focus first on building technical skills and developing some historical context related to game engine development, digital audio production, spatial hearing and spatial audio approaches, and real time motion tracking and interaction. Individual projects for formal class critiques will be proposed by students and may take the form of music composition, virtual sound installation, video game or VR sound design, new sonics forms, etc..

Lectures will examine what makes a successful soundtrack and how music and sound are used to augment gameplay and storytelling. Through composition assignments and critiques, students will hone their sound and music production skills while learning about the unique challenges of writing for games. Assignments range from genre specific music production, to creating adaptive music cues, to implementing music and sound into a game environment.. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin (and its underlying blockchain technology) emerged quietly as a decentralized alternative to the corrupt centralized banking system. In the decade since, cryptocurrencies have seen widespread adoption, bringing with them ludicrous energy consumption and digital cats worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. But the potential of blockchainsnetworked distributed ledgers that keep a tamper-proof record of all transactions that occur on the networkextends far beyond facilitating digital cash. Will blockchains spawn egalitarian techno-utopias free from authoritarian governments and tech companies? Or is the whole 'crypto' enterprise just a wasteful pyramid scheme? This course will explore blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies as both a material and context for artistic experimentation, emphasizing both a cultural and technical understanding of blockchains that can inform critical making. As cultural foundation, we will weave a thread through the invention of money, cryptography, the creation of the Internet, the relationship of cryptocurrencies to anarcho-capitalism and libertarianism, posthumanism, surveillance capitalism, planetary-scale computation, environmental impact, techno-solutionism, meme magic, the NFT/cryptoart market, and the history of conceptual art. Technically, we will learn the basics of public-key/private-key cryptography, crypto-mining, oracles, and the principles behind Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Practically, we will work primarily with the Ethereum blockchain and the Solidity programming language to create our own tokens (fungible and non-fungible), dApps (decentralized Applications), and smart contracts. We will examine works by crypto/blockchain-adjacent artists such as Simon Denny, Primavera De Filippi, Ai Wei Wei, Eve Sussman, Jonas Lund, Sarah Friend, Bitnik, Larva Labs, Stephanie Rothenberg, Julian Oliver, and Terra0. Additionally, we will look at how blockchain-based platforms are transforming the way both digital and physical art are bought and sold. Screenings and readings will provide technical and conceptual foundation for blockchain technology. Students will complete weekly homework assignments, as well as midterm and final projects with respective critiques. While some programming experience is encouraged (JavaScript in particular), no coding experience is needed to make meaningful work in this class..

The human head as a moving and turning pedestal presents continually changing views of sculptural headwear and millinery. Students reconsider the relationship of hat to head, and the potential of traditional and alternative materials. Straw sculpting, block carving, felt blocking, and couture sewing are used in exploration of 'the hat' as a sculptural form.. Giving woven fabrics and alternative flat materials three-dimensional form is key to many sculptural disciplines, most notably headwear design, and garment and fiber works. Beginning with headwear projects as a prime example of self-supported sculptural form, students proceed through a study of methodologies such as pattern drafting, blocking, draping, and carved-form patterning to develop headwear or other objects suiting their individual practice. Assembly is achieved through hand stitching, machine sewing, or innovative techniques appropriate to specific materials. Visual imagery and texts assist in the development of concepts, and the study of interior and exterior space.. Designed to encourage 3-dimensional surface experimentation, this course begins with traditional embellishment methodologies primarily originating in couture millinery, as a means of altering or breaking away surfaces and dimensions. Students then explore alternative materials and methods to transform, mutate or redefine garments, accessories, etc., or to create textured objects in their entirety. To provide related information of interest, selected texts concerning the sociological theories of craftsmanship may be included as well as works by authors like Thor Hanson, Laura Jacobs, Candace Kling, Howard Risatti and Erica Wilson. Field trips to local venues, videos such as the Craft in America series, plus the investigation of works by artists like Nick Cave, Tara Donovan, the Haas Brothers, and Kate MccGwire optionally augment the course content. Projects may be based on up-cycled objects and materials, and will entail various techniques including ribbon manipulation, feather work, flower tooling, and embroidery. Fur/faux sewing and leather tooling are introduced, and other `thread arts? (macrame, tatting, etc.) may be individually investigated in support of conceptual and formal design.. Various investigations are conducted regarding traditional and alternative shoe design and assembly. Assigned readings and discussions focus on history, materials, the designers, lifestyle, terminology and processes, and the involvement of feet and shoes in art. Emphasis is placed on interpreting the foot and shoe for visual presentations and experimenting with components for artistic and practical expression. Final critiques include presentations of one of half pairs of shoes and sandals, illustrations, weekly clipping files and a thematic selection of thematic original ideas. Group critiques are scheduled several times during the semester. Weekly slide lectures, field trips, guest lectures or demonstration enable students to develop their ideas in the studio with a focus on fit and originality..

This class is an explorative approach into traditional and non-traditional methods of creating and manipulating surface through texture. Techniques such as knitting, crocheting, stitching and embellishment will provide a language that speaks about shape and form through construction. Demonstrations will encourage students to create concepts that are three-dimensional in form. Using the body as a foundation in a space, garments and objects that are worn or used will be created as individual projects. Offered in the fall semester only.. This course explores an unconventional view of garment construction and design by framing the process through the parameter of zero waste. Patterns are created using techniques designed to mitigate or eliminate waste. Both traditional and nontraditional materials are used, as well as digital printing technology. All final projects are fitted on a model in both muslin and fabric.. This course will trace the use of structured undergarments worn by women from the eighteenth century to the present day as a basis for the design and construction of garments. Both traditional and nontraditional fabrics and materials are explored while conceptual and historic issues are discussed using references within the department's Fashion Resource Center. All final projects are fitted on a model in both muslin and fabric.. In this workshop students develop a practical understanding of the procedures used by costume designers and their assistants and crew in film and television production. Weekly lectures and hands-on demonstrations focus on projects including breaking down a script based on character and scene, doing research towards developing characters through costume choices, and techniques used to present those choices to the director and producer. Students break down a script from a show in current production. Final critiques include presentation of the breakdown with clip file photos and drawings of their costume choices for the entire script.. In this course the students will study and construct theater masks, corresponding headpieces and mantles or capes. Masks and mantles are based on Commedia dell'arte and baroque silhouettes.

This course focuses on creating promotional posters and book covers, from concept to the final product; telling a story through a single illustration. Divided into four major projects, it covers different stages of creation of a visually engaging illustration; from collecting references, thumbnails, preliminary illustration, to finishing in a medium of choice. It combines fine art with the professional, taking into consideration format, placement, visual hierarchy, and creation of a dynamic figure interacting with a setting. Some classes include guest lecturers.. In this course students immerse themselves in the language of fabrics to express their design concepts in fashion. Students study the origins of a fiber, its use in a yarn, the types of weave, material blends, and fabric finishing all of which result in the distinct characteristics of a material. Students observe how these material conditions determine shape, volume, drape, and flow, and learn the terminology for the professional application. Students study the handling of the fabrics, and stitch sample finishing studies. These material and finishing samples become a personal sample library. This empowers students to discern how to choose or switch fabric to define and push forward their design. Textile terminology will frame the weekly discourse, as new materials are introduced, studied, explored and handled. Draping exercises lead to deepened studies of the materials as they lend themselves to certain forms. Mills, showrooms, and trade representatives will be invited to workshop with the students. Books referenced in this course are focused on basics of textiles and applications including how to handle fabrics: Fabric for Fashion: The Complete Guide, Second Edition; Laurence King Publishing Fabric for Fashion The Swatch Book, Second Edition ; Laurence King Publishing Sewing For Fashion Designers ; Laurence King Publishing In addition students will be introduced to trade organizations which provide educational, as well as trend forecast and sustainability information.

Pre-req FASH 3900..This Graduate Seminar will focus on resuscitating marginalized histories through art and design - with an emphasis on the inherently political nature of knowledge production. The course content will be anchored in ideas around community, Black histories in Chicago, minoritization, and the many stories that can be found in a place as explored through creative works by artists and designers. We will consider how artists and designers engage with histories using both existing and new/innovative research and creative methodologies including (for example) data visualization, embodied or performative strategies, oral histories, archives, collections, etc. We will explore the challenges of creatively responding to histories that have been marginalized or even erased by the dominant (white, Eurocentric, classed) mainstream. Students will engage with histories of their choosing, various forms of research, and creative methodologies to further their practice and interests. We will investigate how archives are used to maintain or challenge the status quo through readings and talks. Some examples include reading Secrecy, Archives, and the Public Interest by Howard Zinn; looking at W.E.B. Du Bois' 'Data Portraits' of turn of the 20th century Black America; online resources including the Tumblr accounts: Medievalpoc and Black Contemporary Art; visiting the Joan Flasch Artists' Book Collection, and/or the Cataloging and Metadata Librarian from the Chicago History Museum.

Readings will include: ?Your House Has a History,? published by the Department of Planning and Development, City of Chicago; National Register Bulletin 15: How to Apply the National Register Criteria; National Register Bulletin 16A: How to Complete the National Register Registration Form; as well as a wide variety of National Register Nominations and Chicago Landmark Designation Reports. Students will develop research, analytic, and writing skills that are fundamental to historic preservation work through the completion of a National Register nomination for an assigned historic building, as well as through several small research and writing assignments. Several guest lectures given throughout the semester will provide students with insight into how research and architectural writing is used in various professional contexts, and students will present their National Register nominations at the end of the semester to a panel of historic preservation professionals.. This course investigates the materials and techniques used in North American building construction. The history and development of materials, their physical properties, and characteristics are studied. Building construction methods are explored including adobe, wood, stone, brick, concrete, and steel construction. Research papers and oral presentations are required. Lecture and field trips.. This class will focus on the general thought processes, cultural contexts, and historical gaffs that lead to both the grassroot efforts and professionalization of Historic Preservation in the United States. Changes within the preservation movement have always been driven by the cultural ethics of the time, so we will increasingly discuss and grapple with current issues that have asked our field to stretch in scope and adapt to the rapidly changing social, economic, and environmental landscapes. This class surveys ideas and approaches to historic preservation from multiple perspectives. We will cover a range of book excerpts, videos, newspaper articles, and other media to show the breadth of the field from both a theoretical and action-oriented perspective. Most of the required reading and viewing will be in pdf and video format and either uploaded to Canvas or linked to the syllabus. By the end of this course, students will be able to articulate precedents in preservation approaches, describe how preservation practices have changed over time and why, weigh and demonstrate a variety of approaches to contentious or culturally-sensitive preservation challenges, demonstrate a self-critical approach, and articulate an ethical position as part of a coherent preservation narrative. Discussion will be key to this process, and a final project may consist of the creation of a zine that highlights a lesser- or un-known narrative about a place.. The documentation of historic cultural resources is critical to the field of historic preservation. By immersion, students will learn photographic, measuring and drawing methods and subsequently develop a deep understanding of the pattern language of architectural drawing. Collections management and inventory will also be addressed. During the course, we will reference the Historic American Buildings Survey collection at the United States Library of Congress. All relevant standards and guidelines issued by the National Park Service will be referenced, as well as previous projects from the HABS collection. By measuring and drawing extant historic objects and structures to exacting standards, students will become familiar with historic construction techniques, building materials and design principles. Students will develop skills and provide final drawings and notes which will be included in the HABS collection.. This lecture/discussion course examines practical and philosophical issues in planning for preservation and the methods for implementation. Among the topics included are preservation surveys and ordinances, zoning and building codes, historical district and landmark designation, design review, preservation agencies (local, state, and national) and their roles, preservation economics and incentives, public relations, and interpretation. Lecture with field trips.. Cultural Landscapes brings students together in an interdisciplinary studio to explore approaches to heritage, site research and environmental remediation through the lens of prophetic mapping. The class will offer both group and individual project development opportunities. The initial phase of work will involve off campus, observational site located studio work - drawing, writing, audio visual recording, material collections and making. The landscapes in the Chicago bio-region will be studied both as layered historical documents and as an inter-connected matrix of living entities, paying close attention to the presence of natural and imposed life sustaining systems. In particular work will focus on the role that water has played, historically and up to the present time in the region. Contemporary discourses about landscape management, ownership, land use, geo-politics and cultural conditions will be explored, considering precedents in the recent past alongside the material heritage of settlement and colonization for their continued significance in the present. A close reading of the landscape of the Chicago region both as a complex of physical places, and as an historically constructed conceptual matrix will also include working with historical maps of the region in local archives. Our initial access to this work will involve acknowledging indigenous precedents and seeking permission, approaching the observation of current conditions as part of a duty of care. Historical approaches to mapping and navigation will be explored also through the first-hand written accounts of journeys, and in colonizer, settlement and resettlement narratives. The class will focus on decentered and decolonized approaches to storytelling, ecological conservation, heritage preservation and civic engagement. This class is open to students from across the school and is designed to offer an interdisciplinary working studio opportunity. Research will emanate from a previously developed resource, a wiki list of Great Lakes Waterkeepers and be carried forward through a Decentered Autonomous Organizational approach initiated by Lauren Bon and the Metabolic Studio in the previous academic year. Readings will examine explorations and concepts of space, place and social interaction fostered through grassroots approaches of ecology and naturalism in the writings of Robin Wall Kimerer, Michael Twitty, Aldo Leopold, and May Theilgaard Watts, and others. Research sources will also include explorations of cultural landscapes by Carl Sauer, William Cronon, and Arijit Sen, landscape historiographies and concepts of deep time are included in readings including, John McPhees Basin and Range, Laurent Oliviers The Dark Abyss of Time, James Lovelocks The Ages of Gaia, David Lowenthals The Past is a Foreign Country, and Obi Kaufmanns California Field Atlas..

Consider the ordinary and extraordinary, the word and world, this color, this art, this way of seeing and being. Writing topics are various in this writing course, but learning objectives are the same: for students to discover the complexity of their thinking through exploration and inquiry and to broaden their expressive and analytical skills. Readings will include writings by essayists, naturalists, and artists. Students maintain a writers notebook, prepare short compositions, and write and revise several essays.. To have curiosity is to be inquisitive, to wonder and to want to know. To be a curiosity, on the other hand, is to be a novelty or rarity, something odd or unusual or strange. In this writing intensive course, students explore curiosities, practice wonder, and pursue questioning. Readings include verbal and visual texts: essays and articles, photographs and artifacts. Students write and revise several essays of modest length, including analyses of visual texts and their own curated collection of curiosities.. This course will focus on texts by ancient and medieval women dating from the earliest years of recorded writings and spanning time up to the Renaissance. Who were the women writing during those mysterious periods? To whom were they speaking and what did they dare to say? For some of them, relatively few of their works have survived for us to read, so our investigation will include consideration of a combination of factors that are relevant to each such as historical perspectives, specific life circumstances, and, of course, the content of their writing. Writers we will study will include Sappho, Sei Shonagon, Hildegard of Bingen, Christine de Pizan, and Akka Mahadevi, among others. As a First Year Seminar I course, the essay writing focus of this class will be to develop and build skills in writing response and analytical essays related to assigned readings, research, and class discussion. The final project will be a research-based presentation, with a creative component.. In this course, we?ll read about witches across diverse forms of literature including folk and fairy tales, poetry, plays, and short stories. We?ll read writing by The Brothers Grimm, Octavia Butler, Arthur Miller, Joy Harjo, Rebecca Tamas, Jane Yolan, and Yumiko Kurahashi to trace the footsteps and flight patterns of witches as they appear in various roles such as mother, monster, healer, and teacher. In support of our investigations, we?ll also read selected critique essays from Donald Haase?s Fairy Tales and Feminism and from Emma Donoghue?s Kissing the Witch, a collection of deconstructed and reassembled fairy tales. As a FYSI course, the core emphasis of this class will be developing writing skills in preparation for FYSII courses and other writing assignments across SAIC?s curriculum. Students will engage in comprehensive discussion of these readings, conduct related research, and write response and analytical essays, with a final project that incorporates a creative component. Music reflects and informs many aspects of society and culture. This course examines the writings of scholars and critics who have argued for various philosophies, functions, and styles of music. Each week, we will feature a topic related to musics role in society and explore issues of aesthetics, expression, and performance. Writing exercises will focus on a specific writing technique or strategy. Students will develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the effectiveness of an authors argument through rhetoric, logic, and evidence. Students will practice making claims and presenting arguments that are successfully supported by writing style, sources, structure, and reason. Students will read a selection of music scholars, critics, and writing specialists, including but not limited to Joseph Auner, Jane Bernstein, Susan Douglas, Hua Hsu, Mark Katz, Alex Ross, and Kate Turabian. Topics vary but may include opera, film music, modernism, music technology, protest music, text setting, and musical genre. In addition to in-class writing assignments, students will write an original research paper, broken down into several assignments/drafts. Students should expect to write 15-20 double-spaced pages over the course of the term, including revisions based on instructor and peer feedback.. FYS I prepares students for advanced study in the Liberal Arts by attending to the foundational skills of college-level writing and interpretation, such as close reading, critical analysis, academic argumentation, essay structure, and style. This first-year seminar focuses our attention on poetry. While it's common for students to find poems baffling or even alienating, we will practice the kinds of reading skills and receptive states of mind that open poetry up to understanding and enjoyment. By reading, discussing, and writing about a small number of short poems every week (drawn from a variety of poets, periods, and places) we will see how reading poetry well does not require elite or occult knowledge but patience, interest, attention, and curiosity. Students will practice reading slowly and closely and writing about poetry in a way that reproduces that slowness and closeness in their own prose. Students should expect to write 15 to 20 pages of formal, revisable writing.. This is a writing course, with the goals of helping you write excellent basic English and developing your skills in presenting arguments, using careful observations of art works and careful readings of writings on art. Reading is one way of improving your writing, and we will study essays almost entirely by artists, likely including photographers (Paul Strand and Edward Weston), painters (Gerhard Richter and Agnes Martin), sculptors (Constantin Brancusi), filmmakers (Dziga Vertov and Maya Deren), architects (Louis Sullivan), and conceptual artists (Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer). We will ",2
SAIC,Art Therapy,"In consultation with Study Abroad, undergraduate students may spend up to two semesters (30 credit hours) at approved partner schools, or at another Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) school in North America. Various types of credit can be earned depending on the host school?s offerings. Approval from Study Abroad is required. The process has two steps; the student first submits an application and portfolio to Study Abroad and it is reviewed by a faculty panel. If approved to proceed, the student then applies to the proposed host school. Information and resources about International Exchange, AICAD Exchange, and Tuition Transfer programs are available at Study Abroad..This course introduces the student to a wide spectrum of performance forms including performance in every day life, rituals, folk forms, artists' actions, experimental dance and theatre, activist performance, and intermedia forms. Students learn the history of performance practices, explore theoretical issues , and develop individual and collaborative works. Primarily a beginner's course but open to all levels of students..

Body As Site is a laboratory for body-based research. Students will be guided to expand the range of ways they move and the kinds of presence they can bring to live art by experimenting with balance, breath, vision, speed, continuity/interruption, and more. The class also introduces research and compositional strategies for generating and developing movement for performance. Working back and forth between improvisational and choreographic modes, students will develop projects that further their individual interests and goals. Course work includes compositional games like the Viewpoints and somatic practices like contact improvisation and butoh. We will look at work by artists including Milka Djordjevich, Tatsumi Hijikata, Tere O?Connor, Okwui Okpokwasili and Jacolby Satterwhite, and documentaries like Paris Is Burning, Pina and Rize. Occasionally short readings will be assigned by writers like Eugenio Barba, Coco Fusco or Susan Rethorst. Students will build performances by responding to objects, sites, rhythms, human collaborators and local live performances. By the end of the semester, students will have presented three substantial performances for critique, and produced many in-class ?micro-performances?- nearly one per week.. This course serves as an introduction to the puppet as performing object from traditional forms to contemporary practice. The class will focus on performance techniques with only basic instruction on fabrication. Students will create short form works centered on the puppet or informed by the language of the puppet. Additionally techniques of co-performance with the puppet and the puppeteer are introduced exploring themes of the doppleganger and the other. Students are exposed to work in the field by attending 3 productions outside of class and viewing of video documentation work such as Handspring, Giselle Vienne, Geumhyung jJeong and Bread & Puppet. Additional readings on contemporary puppet theory are included. The first half of the semester specific performances techniques are introduced such as Guignol hand puppetry, overhead projector and screen and rod shadow puppetry and three-person and one-person Bunraku style doll puppetry. Also introduced are rod puppet, scroll theater, Cantastoria and toy theater performance. Each technique then includes a theme and focus for the creation of a short original work. The second half of the semester focuses on the creation of work of the student?s choosing.. This course offers various topics in contemporary performance. These topics could social practice (e.g. relational art, activism, community-based performance, vernacular performance, performance in everyday life), immersive theatre (e.g. environmental design, interactive architecture, augmented reality), site-specific performance, and art-science collaborations.

These topics could social practice (e.g. relational art, activism, community-based performance, vernacular performance, performance in everyday life), immersive theatre (e.g. environmental design, interactive architecture, augmented reality), site-specific performance, and art-science collaborations. This studio seminar examines an evolving discourse around socially engaged artworks as they intersect with live performance. With particular emphasis on Chicago and its extended community of social practitioners?both artists and activists?and informed by the legacy of Chicago's own Jane Addams and John Dewey, this course investigates the social and communal realms of performance through the works of both local and international artists. Through the class, students will become familiar with the fields of performance and social practice and gain skills for engaging communities in their own practice. This course considers a variety of sources including the writings and scholarshop of Erving Goffman, Arnold Van Gennep, John Dewey, Shannon Jackson, Tom Finkelpearl, Mary Jane Jacob, and Grant Kester as well as the creative practices of Tania Bruguera, Michael Rakowitz, Suzanne Lacy, Rhodessa Jones, Augusto Boal, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Emmanuel Pratt, Theaster Gates, Rick Lowe, and others. Course work includes the creation of two individual performance projects, a mid-term research presentation with written critical response, readings and screenings with attendant discussion and written reflections.. How do we observe seasonal rites, rituals, ceremonies and customs that perhaps are familiar and unfamiliar to us and in conversation with the rural? What is the rural and how can we research and look at it in the lens of living in the city of Chicago, the midwest through the body of performing and performance. How do we observe, embody and queer the rural we will be engaged with in workshop, seminar and presentation over the course of the semester. How do we encounter, engage, through the political, the economic, labour, landscape, communities, and history. We will look at a range of artists from a variety of media (performance, sculpture, fashion, video) who look at and work from the rural. These will include Marcus Coates, Fevered Sleep, Kira O?Reilly, Ralph Meatyard, Charles Freyer, British Folklore, Paul Wright, Queer Appalachia, Derek Jarman, Aine Phillips, Kathleen Stewart, Alex Hoedt, and Samantha Allen. How do you embody a field that sews in spring and harvest in fall? How do you perform time in isolation in smaller communities, away from urban centres? Where is the rural in you? Where is the ritual of home and landscape?. This studio class draws on an eclectic blend of original 'Pocha Nostra' research-based performance exercises investigating 'living dioramas', experimental performance methodologies, Suzuki, dance, ritual practice, conflict resolution techniques and other strategic forms. The techniques evolve from sacred and intimate spaces of human presence, to baroque, highly aesthetic and politicized performances of living murals, human altars, and performance jam sessions. Students create 'hybrid personas,' short performances, spoken word texts, and/or visual media pieces based on their own complex identities and personal sense of politics, race, and gender. Readings and discussions focus on performance theory, popular culture and cultural politics.. The School's much anticipated annual Fashion Show serves as the lab for this course that will involve a cadre of students in all aspects of the production of this large scale performance event. Working directly with students and faculty of the Fashion Department, participants will be engaged in the many elements that comprise this kind of extravaganza. Students will work with the director in creative development of the show. Through direct involvement with the many professionals who put together the show, they will become familiar with set and lighting design, work on music and video segments, help with choreography, learn about publicity and promotion, work with facilities management and be intimately involved in all aspects of Fashion Show Production. As this class shall serve as the core of the production team, participation requires a full commitment to be available for all shows at the beginning of May..This interdisciplinary capstone, with an emphasis on contemporary photography and visual culture, is structured as an intensive critique and mentoring class focused on the development and presentation of culminating work at the end of the BFA and the continued progression of studio work beyond the BFA exhibition. The course supports the production of self-initiated work, a successful BFA show and a road map for a sustainable art practice after graduation. Preparations for the BFA exhibition include workshopping project proposals, budgets, production schedules, the development of new work and an array of possible final presentation forms. Readings, screenings and discussions will examine useful models of participation in cultural production and a critical framework for analyzing a range of platforms to share work online, in print and exhibition. Studio visits will provide insight into the day-to-day life of artists at various stages in their career ranging from current SAIC grad students to working professionals. Online and printed portfolios utilizing an ever-evolving archive of work will be refined along with professional supporting materials such as statements, CVs and artist talks necessary for a professional practice beyond graduation..

This 3 hour reading and discussion class is designed to familiarize students with historical and contemporary philosophy, critical analysis, and contemporary thought relevant to photography and the visual culture. The course's aim is to prepare students for a higher level of discourse in anticipation of either graduate school or life as an artist in the greater realm of the ?art world.? Discussions of contemporary work in this atmosphere are aimed at making clear the connection between theory, research and an artist's practice. Students are expected to do critical readings (generally one essay per week), complete short, informal writing assignments, participate in class discussion, and to engage in theoretical research as part of their own practice.. Large Format Photography introduces students to the ideas and aesthetics associated with a large-format view camera. Students will learn pre-visualization, camera movements, perspective control, large-format optics, and how to handle large format sheet film. Assignments focus on portraiture, landscape, studio, and architecture. Students are encouraged to develop a personal style via flexible assignments. Technical skills acquired include view camera setup and control, experience with sheet film, the zone system, large format scanning, and analog and digital printing. All enrolled students are assigned a 4x5 studio camera and will have access to an 8x10 and 4x5 field cameras, along with a variety of optics and accessories. A variety of technical readings from multiple sources will help students understand perspective control, camera setup, lens choice, bellows extension, available film choices, exposure, and reciprocity compensation associated with large format photography. Additional readings and screenings will provide examples of historical and contemporary work created utilizing large format photography, and highlight the cameras meditative qualities and excellent resolution and control.. Every idea has a medium most suited to its execution, but often not the one in which the artist is working. This class considers new ways of translating ideas into other media to develop a sense of possibilities beyond the straight photograph. Conceptual art has given us an understanding of the triggers that might provoke an investigation of layers of meaning within the simplest of ideas. Assignment encourage students to think beyond the usual way they work and include the use of collaboration, installation, audio, video, live feed, the internet, performance, and performative uses of photography.. The Anthropocene is the name of the new geological epoch, first proposed by atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and marine biologist Eugene F. Stroemer in 2000, with the proposal that human species has become the single prominent agent of change affecting the earths geology and ecosystems. Since then, the conversations on the Anthropocene, climate change, sustainability and the planetary ecological crisis have proven that the extremely complex problems the Earth is facing can only be addressed by new forms of collaboration and innovative knowledge production. Photography plays in this context a pivotal role and goal of this class is to promote empirical and forensic work on landscapes of the Anthropocene, the degraded and damaged ecologies of the planet Earth. Collaborative work and access to different material forms, laboratories, analog and digital photographic media as well as scholarship and first-person testimony on health, race, politics and aesthetics, will help generate diverse perspectives on the entangled realities of the world and the complex human-natural systems. Questions of environmental justice and environmental ethics will take center stage in this class. Photography will help to transform cognition into experience and practice into cognition, making invisible processes available to our perception. There will be multiple excursions, meetings with artists, scholars and scientists, but also studio time and critiques.. Topics courses cover a wide range of aesthetic concerns and change according to the semester and faculty, allowing a more in-depth examination of specific topics within photography. The courses provide students access to the specific topics driving faculty research and practice, as well as allowing the department to nimbly address issues pressing to our current context and time.

With various degrees of complexity, one can vary and confuse the way a narrative is arranged. This course is designed to introduce exclusive, hands-on artmaking experiences with various photo processes and non-traditional bookmaking techniques. This course is tailored to meet the needs of students seeking both new methods of image-making processes in photography and unique structures of various book types. Students will be challenged to work with images by constructing their narratives into book structures. This class will cover a wide range of photographic processes (Cyanotype, Brown-toned Print, Various Transfer Methods, Traditional Gelatine Silver Print) and non-traditional bookmaking techniques (Simple Folds Book, Accordion Book, Stab-binding, Drum-leaf binding, Flag Book, Waterfall FlipBook, Unique Fold Book, Portfolio Case). Visits to Joan Flasch Artists' Books Collection take place frequently when needed. The class provides slide presentations and several individual and group critiques. Taking chances, pushing boundaries, improvising, and experimenting with these new alternative techniques will be heavily explored when students develop their final projects. The outcome of the class is a work where content and structure form a complete aesthetic. Students will be expected to produce minor books, zines showing proficiency in both book building, photographic projects and the appropriateness of their choices. Sharing of ideas will come from regular show-and-tells of what has been done and work in progress working toward a final coherent book project. Assessment and aid will also stem from individual meetings. From these contacts examples mainly from the Joan Flasch Artist Book Collection but also specific tailored readings.. This course offers advanced exploration with visual and written material in paged sequence. Ideas are encouraged within a broad range of possibilities, via the format of the artist' book. The development of a major project is encouraged.. This course will look at the inseparable link between comic stories and how they are reproduced. In the first half of the semester, we will gain familiarity with screenprint and risograph printing techniques, look at historical and contemporary examples of how artists employ print technology to tell stories and do in-class exercises. In the second half, students will produce their own printed comics and discuss them in group critiques.. This intermediate studio will explore Lithography as an expanded practice for creating fine art prints that are both innovative and experimental. The course will focus on both individual and collaborative projects to expand the notions and practice of traditional lithography by combining it with other artistic practices. Students will be introduced with advanced printing processes including multi-color printing using stone and aluminum plate, photo and wood lithography, and monotype/monoprints. Use of laser and vinyl cutters to combine with traditional lithography will also be explored.. This course introduces students to the use of RISOgraph image duplication as a creative, independent publishing tool. Attention will be paid to ways artists' publishing has publishing has been used to bypass traditional cultural and institutional gatekeepers, to foster community, as well as the distribution of independent ideas and content. Studio work will be supplemented with readings, visits to SAIC special collections and class discussion addressing contemporary and modern artists. Studio experimentation and research will be encouraged.. This seminar is designed to provide practical and aesthetic dialogue for students, centered around the production of works on paper. Classes will be held often in the Jean and Steven Goldman Study Center, where the focus will be first hand experience of works in the collection of the Art Institute, providing an overview of the History of Prints and Drawings. Through contact with artists and art workers, we will discuss issues of professional presentation, conservation tips, and strategies for professional life beyond school. Included is a field trip to a private collection in Chicago focused on the work of younger artists, giving students valuable insight into why and how people collect. The format will be split between discussion of participants' work and the study of printed art and drawing, especially focused on the period after 1900.. Designed for advanced-level Printmedia students, this course centers the studio as a site for physical and conceptual production. A combination of independent work time, individual meetings, group critiques and assigned prompts form the bulk of course programming. Students are expected to set personal goals informed by dialogue with course faculty and studio peers. Attention will be paid to independent practices and/or professional strategies beyond school. The course supports student production of a focused body of creative work. Students accepted into this section will be given an undergraduate studio in the 280 Building. Please note that during class time, students in this section don't have access to any print facilities other than their studio space. Application is required for consideration.. This course facilitates students who have progressed beyond the advanced 3000 level classes offered by the Department of Printmedia. Students are expected to be self-motivated and capable of working in an interdisciplinary and mature fashion. Students accepted into this section will have access to print facilities during class, with the exception of Room 220. Application is required for consideration..In this class we will prepare the student for life out of school through looking at at the lives of artists through their writings and biographies. Artists writings/biographies will include Joan Mitchell, Fairfield Porter, Andrey Tarkovsky, Seth Price, Laura Owens, among others. Group critiques and a field trip to an artist studio will be included, as well as practical advice on documenting work and writing artist statements.. In ?I Made a Thing?,? a Professional Practice Experience course offering, you will engage in a wide variety of activities designed to help prepare you for life after SAIC. Course activities may include creating a website, preparing a CV, attending networking events with alumni, and writing of a project statement. The course emphasizes hands-on, real-world professional activities and opportunities for emerging studio artists. This course will be broken into six units, each of which addresses a particular concern about what to do with studio work once it has been made. Each unit will typically contain a reading assignment, a writing assignment, and a project assignment. This course would be best suited for artists who are considering a career centered around an individually driven studio practice. Units include: I Made a Thing and I think I want to make more: how to develop a practical, long-term studio practice. I Made a Thing and I think it failed: how to embrace inevitable challenges and let your work be your teacher. I Made a Thing and I think I want people to look at it: how to cultivate a supportive creative community both physically and virtually. I Made a Thing and I think I want to use it to apply to/for stuff: how to get your work ?out there.? I Made a Thing and I think I want people to talk about it: how to engage your work with dialogue and criticism. I Made a Thing and I think I want someone to buy it: how to create your own art market.. This professional practice class focuses on the history and current practice of artist-run art spaces in Chicago. Students will research historical artist-driven culture and meet with current artists/curators. Readings and lectures will look at different models of exhibiting artwork, working within economic constraints, and terrain of the art market. Students will build professional skills such as writing an artist statement, curriculum vitae, artist talks, documenting work, and applying to opportunities like residencies or grants. The class will curate and produce a collaborative exhibition as a culminating event.. Painting Practice is an introductory painting course offering.

This studio course will provide a hands-on introduction to the fundamental understanding and use of color. Students will gain practical experience working with material color in order to improve their understanding of how color works. Assignments will be introduced in class to help students develop a working knowledge of the basic concepts of hue, value, and chroma, and the relationship between these concepts and those of color harmony and organization. By working with color in context students will gain a practical understanding of color interaction and develop strategies for approaching color with greater sophistication and specificity in their own practice. In addition to our investigations with color in the classroom, this course will examine the ways in which artists and scholars have worked with color art historically as a medium of expression, and thought about color scientifically as an index of an underlying natural order, as well as culturally as a system of signs reflecting our biases back to us to be interpreted. Reliable perceptual phenomena like simultaneous contrast and afterimages will be considered alongside more unstable notions like synesthesia and color music, as well as the complicated history of thinking about color as evidence of that which is ?other.? Course work ",2
SAIC,Career & Professnl Experience,"This course will introduce students to basic techniques of working with sound as an artistic material. As a prerequisite for many of the department?s upper level offerings, the class is designed to familiarize the student with both the technology and the historical and aesthetic background relevant to our facilities and courses, to the field of ?sound art? and experimental music in general, and to the application of sound in other disciplines (video, film, performance, installations, etc.) Equipment covered will include microphones, mixers, analog and digital audio recorders, signal processors and analog synthesizers. Hard-disk based recording and editing (ProTools) is introduced, but the focus is on more traditional analog studio technology. The physics of sound will be a recurring subject. Examples of music and sound art, created using similar technology to that in our studios, will be played or performed and discussed in class. The listening list will vary according to the instructors? preferences. Readings are similarly set according to the instructors? syllabus: some sections employ more or less reading than others, contact specific instructors for details. Students are expected to use studio time to complete weekly assignments, which are designed to hone technical skills and, in most cases, foster artistic innovation. Some of these projects can incorporate outside resources (such as the student?s own computers and recordings), but the emphasis is on mastering the studio..

This course is a sound production practicum with a focus on sampling and appropriation. Students will engage sound archives as a resource for creative sound design and music production. The seminar will consider contemporary strategies of sampling and appropriation in the context of popular culture, media preservation and intermedia design. Special attention will be given to public sound archives and library collections. Coursework includes bi-weekly reading responses, a mid-term, and a final project. Final projects can take form as a research based text or as a creative project that blends modes of creative production. Students are expected to actively and critically engage the social, political and cultural factors that inform their practice. Course readings explore the scholarly discourse on Interculturalism with focus on processes, structures, systems, and methodology in relation to the moral, ethical and aesthetic questions raised by working with cultural artifacts as material. The seminar encourages trans-disciplinary methodology and cross-media production and is structured as a modified in-person course. The hybrid format includes weekly online topics lectures, student led group discussions and individual student meetings. Online discussion groups will be created for each unit. Students are expected to participate in online discussions in response to unit readings, case studies and discussion prompts. In person studio and access to technology and tech support will be facilitated for students who wish to have access to campus resources.. This course is founded on exploring and understanding the richness and diversity of our sound environment: the sounds that are present, how they constantly change in time, their impact socially and individually, and how they can be attentively recorded and creatively deployed. Research conducted through recording will serve as a basis for discussion of acoustic ecology: an interdisciplinary concern with the social, scientific, and aesthetic interrelationships between individuals and their environment mediated by sound. Students will gain technical and critical skills and an understanding of the reciprocity of listening and sound-making, leading to increasing the potential for effective public engagement and social practice, and engaging with human perception and technology in human and non-human eco-systems. Coursework is supplemented by examining works by artists and writers including Steven Feld, R. Murray Schafer, Annea Lockwood, Pauline Oliveros, Chris Watson, Hildegard Westerkamp, Luz Maria Sanchez, Amanda Gutierrez, Leah Barclay, Christopher DeLaurenti, Jonathan Sterne, Francisco Lopez, Norman Long, Viv Corringham, Christina Kubisch, Andra McCartney, Jean-Franois Augoyard, Henri Torgue, Andrea Polli, Manuel Rocha Irtube and others. Assigned projects include but are not limited to field recording, soundwalking, mapping, habitat monitoring and restoration, learning and cognition, communications, and soundscape composition. These lead to independent individual or collaborative projects.. In thinking about slang, dialects, regional vernacular, language mixing, and code switching, how do we extract the sounds that we make that connect us to our families, communities and places of origin? How do we have to alter and shift these natural sounds in an effort to assimilate? We will explore various ways that our tongues convey language through visual and sonic expressions, storytelling, recordings and written documentation. This course is open to writers, visual artists, sound makers and anyone else interested in the sounds that we make to communicate and how they are seen and heard. We will use class time to read, record and/or perform text-based work: poems, essays, academic papers, literature. This includes work by April Baker-Bell, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Wanda Coleman, Rosario Maria Gutierrez Eskildsen, Lingua Franca, Zora Neale Hurston, Chi Luu, and John J. Ohala, among others. Students respond to readings and the presentation of artists' works, and produce individual text-based sound projects using the technologies of their choice, or no technoloogies at all. Students engage in group critiques for all projects.. This course focuses on the relationship of sound to moving image, and introduces post-production techniques and strategies that address this relationship as a compositional imperative. Thorough instruction is given on digital audio post-production techniques for moving image, including recording, sound file imports, soundtrack composition and assembly, sound design, and mixing in stereo and surround-sound. This is supplemented by presentations on acoustics and auditory perception. Assigned readings in theories and strategies of sound-image relationships inform studio instruction. Assigned projects focus on gaining post-production skills, and students produce independent projects of their own that integrate sound and moving image. Artists include Chantal Dumas, Walter Verdin, Deborah Stratman, Lucrecia Martel, Martin Scorcese, Abigail Child, Frederic Moffet, Gyorgi Palvi, Francis Ford Coppola, Gary Hill, and others. Writings in theory include texts by Michel Chion, Rick Altman, and others. The student?s independent image-and-sound work is foregrounded and supported; supplemental assigned projects include sound sequence composition and ADR recording and mixing.. This course considers the building blocks of modular analog synthesis- oscillators, amplifiers, and filters, using vintage and modern analog equipment. The course also considers various frequency and amplitude modulation techniques, including ring modulation and frequency shifting. These techniques are contextualized in a brief survey of the history of `classical' analog synthesis music, both European and American, with some analysis of classical studio technique in the work of composers such as Stockhausen, Berio, Koenig, Subotnik, Oliveros, Babbit, etc. Weekly compositional projects emphasize particular technical and aesthetic problems.. This class is intended for advanced undergraduates and graduates who are interested in the use of sound in an installation context. It is expected that students may come from a diverse set of backgrounds, and as such this course will be to some degree determined by the background of the students, and their specific needs. The course will include critical discussions of sound art and related installation and media art practices: a brief history of the sound/art interface, a brief introduction to acoustics, and readings by theorists and artists such as R.M. Schafer, Sterne, LaBelle, Cage, Lucier, Kahn, Lockwood, Fontana, Panhuysen, Lerman, Neuhaus, Monahan, Kim-Cohen, Kubitsch, Hellstrom, and Wollscheid. The topic of real-life sound installation exhibition and social context will also be covered, with input from the SAIC Exhibitions and Events Department. The course will also cover various methodologies for using/creating sound in installations through tutorials that are designed to give functional knowledge of each particular technique, as well as an introduction to the possibilities these techniques. Depending on the students? backgrounds and needs, potential topics for these tutorials include: basic sound recording and playback techniques, basic sound synthesis and electronics for audio, digital sound recording and editing, the fabrication of mechanical systems which create sound, using MAX (a visual MIDI programming language used for control and for processing audio), basic electronics for environmental sensing (sound, light, motion, etc.). In addition to working on various preliminary individual and collaborative projects during the semester, students will write a proposal for and present an installation as their final project.. This course will provide an introduction to programming for sound synthesis and real-time performance using the Max/MSP and Supercollider II languages. Students will learn the basic structures, strategies, concepts, and vocabularies of these two languages in order to prepare them for using these techniques within other sound department courses.. This course approaches the tools provided by game engines as an experimental sound studio capable of creating new kinds of digital audio works for un-fixed media. Procedural audio tools can lead to endlessly evolving sound compositions and generative music; interactivity can empower navigability through sonic worlds, virtual sound installations, or the creation of new instruments; physics simulations can allow for real, hyperreal, and unreal audio environments for listeners, viewers, and gamers. Starting from the first day with the download of a game engine and a digital audio workstation and ending on the last with the critique of a sound-focused work, this class will provide a thorough introduction to authoring sound-focused art experiences using game engines. Some of the scholars/artists we will study in this course include Janet Cardiff & George Bures Millers audio walks, Peter Gena, Poppy Crum, Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers among others. Of particular interest are works that explore the use of real time, interactive, and emergent systems that critically address the ways that sound, action, and presence shape the experience of listening bodies. Screening may include virtual reality works such as Notes on Blindness by Colinart, La Burthe, and Middleton and Spinney or spatial audio experiences such as Scott Reithemans Boom App. Through weekly assignments and class studio time, we will focus first on building technical skills and developing some historical context related to game engine development, digital audio production, spatial hearing and spatial audio approaches, and real time motion tracking and interaction. Individual projects for formal class critiques will be proposed by students and may take the form of music composition, virtual sound installation, video game or VR sound design, new sonics forms, etc..This research, discussion, and critique course develops a visual and verbal vocabulary by examining relationships between form and content, word and image.

Image Studio is a course that challenges students to interpret, critically read text, conceptualize, and assess project parameters to implement design solutions. The creative process is a core focus throughout the assignments. The goal of this course is to explore the process of creating original imagery and visual information. We utilize digital and analog means to create design solutions to projects that also require fundamental explorations with typography. We explore a diverse means of image construction from paper collage to photography and Photoshop manipulation. Form studies examine design basics such as juxtaposition, repetition, and progression as well as the use of metaphor, analogy, and semiotics. The introduction of design context, audience awareness, and sequential narrative is also addressed..

This studio course explores typography's impact on language to create meaning, organization and tone. Students experiment in typographic composition and page structure with special regard to the flow and rupture of different text types and reading scenarios. Students learn the technical aspects of typography (specification and copyfitting), methods for composing dynamic multipage formats (combining digital and analog), and contexts (both historical and structural) for understanding the vast repository of typefaces. This course is a core requirement for the Visual Communication Design portfolio review. The framing text for this class is Ellen Lupton's Thinking with Type. But students will be introduced to numerous examples from the history of (predominantly Western) letterforms and concretized language. Understanding these historical forms in their contexts will reveal the logic behind the modern classification of digital type. Students produce weekly type projects which are critiqued and handed in as three project sets. The first set analyses letterforms, structurally and then programmatically. The next project set covers text setting and typographic compositions of increasing semantic and syntactic complexity. The last project is a multilingual, illustrated book layout where students engage the fundamental concept of 'structured variety' over a series of pages..

SAIC,Ceramics,"Designed to unify the experience of the post-baccalaureate studio program, this class explores how an artist develops a body of work. This includes discussions of working processes and issues in art, critiques and explorations of resourses of the School, museum and city.. This seminar will introduce students to contemporary visual communication theories and realities by presenting diverse models of design practice and counter-practice. A series of visiting designers and artists will represent their own working relationships within the realms of commerce/culture/community, to expose students to the evolving range of theoretical, aesthetic, and professional options open to them. Students will engage with contextual readings and conduct self-directed research, in order to inform the development of a series of brief conceptual design exercises and/or analytical writings..This course offers several graduate-level trajectories through visual studies, each with its own historical precedent, some drawn from neighboring disciplines and some manufactured sui generis, but all sharing one common concern: how power manifests and what it might mean to bear witness. Each week begins with a canonical text and extends its lineage to contemporary thinkers invested in how a schematic of power concretizes through the shifting context of our current moment. Contained here are multiple histories of ways of seeing, state surveillance and policing, biopower and state sovereignty, queer embodiments and the representation of gendered and raced bodies, time and its illusions, visual networks and otherwise occluded spaces of technology, and the spectacle of capitalism. The final half of the term will be devoted to your own work, in the form of shared research, lecture-conversations, and seminar papers. [This is a required course for first-year students in the MA in VCS program.]. This course spans centuries but focuses on the thin line between looking and reading, imagining and writing. Considering the question, ?What is language?? leads us to readings in linguistics from art historical, literary-theoretical, philosophical, and ethnographic disciplines. We also pursue connections between ?seen words? in movements such as pop art, conceptual art, concrete poetry, language poetry, and conceptual writing by comparing works in various media that revolve around distinctions between speech, writing, the static and moving image. Notable authors and artists include Vito Acconci, Bob Brown, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Jacques Derrida, Carl Dryer, Paul Friedrich, Luce Irigaray, Roman Jakobson, Rene Magritte, Ed Ruscha, Sapir-Whorf, Hannah Weiner, Ludwig Wittgenstein and others.. What if I told you that trendcasting was all we had left? What if, like Adam Curtis in his most recent documentary Hypernormalisation, I whispered to you that we had been sold a fake world so glossy that the very real bait-and-switch democratic entanglements that sold politics and principles for the corporate bank bailouts and B-movie Good vs. Evil narratives necessary to produce it seemed more the provenance of speculative science-fiction. This course considers the order of the simulated (the stuff of Baudrillard, but be honest: any modernist fable of progress will do) as a system of poetics, a sort of new media infrastructure meets lo-fi aesthetic inquiry, and all the impossibly perverse combinations in between. It looks to filmmakers like Curtis, who in works like the aforementioned Hypernormalisation and Bitter Lake, mines an archive of BBC footage lost someplace in the chasm between the techno-developments of VHS tapes and streaming UK proxy iPlayers, to dredge up a maximalist narrative of finance capital at the end of the world that resembles the PowerPoint that ate your YouTube playlist. It wonders about the shark that bit into the fiber optic telecommunications cable artist Trevor Paglen (see also: cinematographer for the Laura Poitras Snowden doc Citizenfour) took scuba lessons to document off the coast of Guam (and later it wonders about the Richard Branson-esque, $500 private tours Paglen offers of this ?artwork?). That?s sort of poetic, right? It builds off the course ?How to Fake the Internet? and further pushes the algorithmic order of our inquiries into the crevices of the conceptual equivalent of Buzzfeed listicles, as we contribute to a dialectic of progress/regress and our language turns into solipsistic Bitmoji hieroglyphs and the myth of a Dana Ward poem. What do we read? We read Aristotle and Schopenhauer, Rhizome and e-flux and all that bad `80s theory that introduced ?the virtual? and ?the cyber? and ?the simulacra.? We read Samuel R. Delaney and NSA Whistleblower Bill Binney and the history of internet aesthetics and AOL brand management. We read POEMS (p-o-e-m-s). We watch Rachel Rose vids. We read interviews with casual ornithologists turned darling novelists and early labor relation theorists turned polymaths turned government informants. We measure our days in social media metrics and watch the very first episode of Days of Our Lives. We are Danny Brown and Murphy Brown and Dan Brown and Barbara Browning and Brown University?s Department of Media and Mass Culture and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown?s undoing and the unincorporated community of Brown, Oklahoma; we are also the reason why ?disambiguation? is more widely circulated as a Google Ngram than ?solidarity.? Don?t forget that The Sopranos started with a single psychotherapy session.. In the introduction to Burning with Desire, Geoffrey Batchen suggests that the study of photography has been largely divided by two opposing points of view, one that is interested in the essential, formal characteristics of photography and another that considers photography, and photographic meaning, to be determined by cultural context. Starting with this general rubric, we examine how that divide is addressed, reinforced, reconfigured and dismantled in recent studies of photography. Readings range from the pre-history of photography to digital imaging. We discuss works by cultural historians and art historians, and consider both popular and professional photographic practices. Texts will include books by Geoffrey Batchen, Carol Mavor, Robin Kelsey, Blake Stimson, and Christopher Pinney, among others. Class assignments include rigorous weekly discussions of the readings, two turns at leading class discussions, a final presentation based on the final project for the course, and a final project that may be written (15 pages) or studio-based.. Psychoacoustic research entered the popular consciousness at the frontier of media studies, imaged as the future of art and listening. This course considers a range of experiments in recorded sound and the growing archive of human sonic ecologies: sonic utopias, cyborg sound poems, the human archiving of self, and popular culture phantasmal media -- a blend of cultural ideas and sensory imagination.. This course is a graduate studio critique for both MAVCS students and MFA students. The course is structured as a hybrid seminar / critique with weekly readings, discussion and studio critique sessions. In addition to studio visits and critiques, the course also includes writing assignments as an integrated element of contemporary studio practice. The seminar will include readings and case studies with a focus on artists that work with film, video, multi-media performance and immersive environments. The course is open to students working in all practices, across disciplines and students working through hybrid and emergent digital practices.. The thesis, as the final requirement to be fulfilled for the Masters of Art degree in Visual and Critical Studies, is expected to constitute an original contribution to the current body of research in its field. For the thesis, students are encouraged to use innovative approaches to research and analysis, and the formats with which they disseminate the outcomes of their research. The thesis requirement may be satisfied in a variety of ways incorporating visual, sonic, and verbal media. This seminar assists the student in selecting, researching, analyzing, designing, and, organizing the thesis. During this semester, the student selects her or his thesis advisor and two other faculty committee members and defends the proposal before this panel. The student also completes most of the research and the preliminary work for the thesis. This seminar is required for the Master of Arts in Visual and Critical Studies. Open to MAVCS students only.. This class is premised on the idea that language spoken, written, published, discursed, and so on constitutes immense potential for studio practice. Creative textual practices abound in poetry, essays, fiction, print, painting, installation, screen and web technologies, and lectures, but perhaps even more intriguingly, in the figurative and literal margins of these practices. Students will be tasked with executing self-initiated projects, thinking critically about their own and others work, planning and implementing detailed proposals, and engaging in wider cultures that influence contemporary language practices. Class sessions will include individual work time supported by mentoring with faculty as well as critique. The class includes viewing the work of a set of artists and writers who are diverse both in terms of identity and in practice. Examples range from formal play with text to political engagements. Artists and writers to be considered include but are not limited to Glenn Ligon, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, Mel Bochner, Christine Sun Kim, Tony Lewis, Lawrence Weiner, Kay Rosen, Edgar Heap of Birds, Susan Howe, Hito Steyerl, Raymond Pettibon, Aram Saroyan, Robin Deacon, Gregg Bordowitz, Nyeema Morgan, Bruce Nauman, Jessica Vaughn, Sol LeWitt, Kenneth Goldsmith, Hans Haake, Ed Rucha, Martin Creed, Gertrude Stein, Settler Colonial City Project, Forensic Architecture, Christian Bk, Christopher Wool, Joseph Grigely, and Park McArthur. As a Capstone class, students will be challenged to discuss their practice effectively and engage in critical dialog with their peers as well as interrogate how language becomes assembled and documented material. This may include investigating strategies of exhibition and publication.. This course is a a workshop introducing studio art students to various kinds of writing they can do to prepare them for professional opportunities. We will focus on connecting students to their own projects through writing and then we will discuss how that writing can be used to serve more practical ends. Instead of starting with practical requirements such as artist statments and grant applications, we will first work to build students? personal vocabularies and ways of talking about their practices. Emphasis will be on experimentation and building comfort with language. Readings will be a combination of various forms artists? writings (diaries, interviews, sketchbooks, etc) and various formats (artist statments, grant applications, professional situations) where artists are expected to present their work in language. We will use Social Medium: Artists Writing 2000-2015 as a sourcebook for examples of writing by contemporary artists and students will also be asked to collect thier own sources of inspiration from fields appropriate to their work. Coursework focuses on weekly prompts, which will be workshopped and revised. Final projects will relate to students? own goals for presenting their studio work, including websites, grant applications, and artist statements.. This three hour seminar is a professional practice class which examines what it means to have a productive, critical practice. Students not only refine their own identity as generative artist-scholar-citizen but also learn to represent that practice professionally with CVs, portfolios, project proposals, artist statements, and scholarly abstracts. Students also work collaboratively on exhibition projects to experience how different creative roles such as artists, curators, writers, and venue directors interact in the art world.. This course plunges students into content and ideas that universities often leave until graduate school, as we consider the role played by the 'critical' in 'visual and critical studies.' For the past ten years, it has been referred to as 'a primer for the art world.' It will still, mostly, provide you with a working vocabulary and crash course as to bodies of knowledge integral to the study of visual culture. At the same time, to productively engage in a reflective critique of society and culture, it will consider 'texts' from as diverse and contemporaneous a group of scholars, theorists, critics, and cultural producers as possible, from both inside and outside the academic institution..

This seminar explores various media industries from both US and Global perspectives. A number of major topic areas are examined. We historically compare the media industries before the Internet era. We then take an overview of a variety of today's media businesses followed by an examination of current global television business and management structures. We also survey the competitive and creative outlook in areas such as programming, distribution, markets and seek to develop a basic knowledge of nomenclature, practices and career paths. Readings include work by media theorists such as Theodor Adorno and Marshall McLuhan and by contemporary business strategists Jim Collins and Morten Hansen. Screenings include documentaries by Adam Curtis and Douglas Rushkoff. Assignments include responses to weekly readings, a commentary on current research, an at home exam that examines readings in-depth, and a project that explores each students interest in the media industries.. This course provides an introduction to social theories of visual communication and to methods of critiquing, producing, and displaying visual representations of cultural phenomena. Drawing primarily from anthropology and ethnographic research, students will explore the significance of visual images to represent and document identity, behavior, and everyday life. This includes examining how even ways of viewing - sight - are shaped, and also vary by and within, culture. Influences from film, photography, and graphic design provide examples of how the social sciences may incorporate these technologies from other disciplines, into behavioral analysis and to understand culture. However, the consequences of visual content creation and circulation (unintended or otherwise), features heavily in the course topics such as: travel photography, photojournalism, social media, and digital activism. Course readings and ethnographic films focus on documentary developments spanning the 20th century - from the silent picture era, scientific cinema, and cinema verite - to internet media like virtual reality, gifs, screenshots, and Tik Toks. In reviewing this learning content, students will conduct comparative analysis of still, moving, and digital images while also creating their own visual content in the process. Learning activities include in-class breakout groups and students presentations, as well as independent work involving ethnographic drawing, a photo essay, film critique paper, and meme ethnography research project.. This collaborative, community-based course is centered around The LGBTQ+ Intergenerational Dialogue Project, an ongoing partnership between Center on Halsted and SAIC. Classes will be held both at SAIC and Center on Halsted. Bringing together LGBTQ+-identified students and elders, this project provides a rare opportunity for dialogue across queer generations. Participants discuss, from their various perspectives and experiences, topics central to LGBTQ+ lives and histories such as Gender, Sex, Spirituality, Art, LGBTQ+ History, Family, Race, Class, Coming Out, Aging and Ageism, and Activism and Social Movements. Readings, audio recordings, and screenings will explore LGBTQ+ histories through their representation in various forms. Over the course of the semester, students work collaboratively with elders in small groups to create objects'' in various forms (such as an animated video, comics zine, oral history, reflective or critical essay, personal narrative, visual art piece, or photographic essay) that bring to life the stories, histories, and lived experiences of LGBTQ+ folks. These objects'' will be featured on our website (generationliberation.com).. This class plots domestic histories of design in pursuit of inclusive design and community. Readings, writings, and collective experiments in sewing, cooking, organizing, and caregiving explore the pleasures and constraints of domestic life; adaptation of commercial designs and DIY kits; and plotting design justice futures. Making and writing options are introduced throughout the course and are flexible to students of all skill levels. This course combines making with research to shape our field of study. Historical materials include sewing patterns, feminist housekeeping critiques, and Flaxman Librarys extensive collection of cookbooks. Making projects (no skills/experience required) focus on DIY learning, learning through verbal and visual cues rather than written ones, and collective stitch-n-bitch models. Readings include theories of the family and queer domesticity; disability and illness as a part of home design and adaptation; and feminist and anti-racist critiques of household labor and proposals for liberatory alternatives. All students in this class will make things, engage with a variety of writing modes, and combine traditional research methods with the knowledge gained through making. Reading responses and papers will accompany their practice-based material culture study. Final projects will include a choice of formats incorporating historical research.. This course aims to critically examine the affects of race and representation of others. Students will interpret nineteenth-century and early 20th-century material and non-material culture from anti-slavery and pro-slavery sources, including biblical literature, slave narratives, print media, music, visual art, and ephemera. The course considers moral motivations for recognition, empathy, assistance, and liberation of others in an era of sentimentalism. Students will interrogate modern ideas in helping relationships as they learn to 1.) explore the role of cultural materials in preserving trauma or the history of violence; 2.) discuss the role of cultural imagery in the production of charity and empathy; and 3.) ask contemporary questions about the role of desire in feeling responsibility and doing good. Throughout the course, students will be required to travel to several local archives including the Newberry Library and the Stony Island Arts Bank for research.. This course explores artistic, tactical, theoretical, cultural and pedagogical approaches to resisting Empire through the work of John Akomfrah, Black Audio Collective, #decolonizethisplace, Sky Hopinka, Tirza Even, Forensic Architecture, Rafa Esparza, Damon Locks, SuperFutures Haunt Collective and Santiago X. We will consider how artists, activists and scholars destabilize linear time, imagine queer futures and utopias by remixing hegemonic forms of social memory including archives, explore community-based knowledges and develop reparative counter-narratives. Structure: Readings, discussions, presentations, visits to Chicago archives, guest lectures, and development of pedagogical materials and/or scholarly/creative projects. Group research trips include visits to libraries and collections to meet with archivists and researchers, including the following sites: the Gerber Hardt Library for GLBTQ studies, American Indian Center, Leather Archive and Museum, Edward E. Ayers Collection of native studies at the Newberry, Vivian G. Harsch, Harold Washington Special Collections and visits to informal, uncurated collections, including flea markets. Readings may include Eve Tuck, Audra Simpson, Stuart Hall, Russell West-Pavlov, Tina Campt, Gerald Vizenor, Jose Esteban Mu?oz, Arjun Appadurai, Tananarive Due, and Saidiya Hartman. Students will engage in weekly discussions to readings, 3 written responses, conduct an independent visit to a collection and present findings. Final projects may include hybrid production: written, artistic and/or pedagogical projects, final presentation and critique.. See topic description for more information.. This course enables upper-level students to develop a well-researched thesis project on a topic of their choice. Such a thesis project may be linked to their final BFA thesis or studio project, and may be useful for students considering graduate school in a field in which research and writing expertise is required. Students may choose to enlist innovative formats and incorporate a variety of media. Topics as diverse as 'Gay Cinema,' 'Culture as Industry,' 'Is Rap Subversive?,' 'The Art and Science of Fragrance,' and 'The Morphology of the Toy Soldier Body' have been explored. Class meetings are used to share research methods, discuss the given challenges of various projects, and present works-in-progress for critique..What does it mean to be a successful artist? What does it take to function as an artist in today?s highly competitive art world? How can we envision a practice that is sustainable and exciting? In this highly diverse and interdisciplinary art world everything is possible, and everyday you have to hustle. In this three-hour seminar students will work on their artist statements, CVs, websites, and present artist talks. The course will focus on a series of visits to meet professional artists who find creative ways to sustain their practices. We will also visit various sites around Chicago including established galleries, apartment galleries, artist studios, museums, and meet the professionals who make these spaces function with their hustle.",2
SAIC,Contemporary Practices,"Introductory design studio examines the role of the building envelope in architectural design, focusing on its relation to program, site, form and materials. Course Goals and Objectives 1) Integrate ideas about enclosure and envelope with scale, site, structure, program and form, experimenting with skin effects and affects as a generator of a design, adapting an existing building, and addressing the existing building envelope. 2) Investigate the design of building skins including design, technical, structural, environmental, and social performance, ranging from cultural questions to accessibility, through the conceptual design of a small public building. 3) Develop design and graphic skills by completing the conceptual design of a small public building with a complex program, producing architectural drawings and models at an accomplished level, demonstrating a command of drawing and modeling conventions and an ability to manipulate those conventions to convey ideas relevant to a particular design idea. 4) Demonstrate awareness of the role of accessibility and sustainability in the design process..AIA THESIS at SAIC is a two-semester course sequence that asks students to rigorously investigate a contemporary topic in architecture and create an installation advancing discourse and practice related to that topic. Students focus on the potential for challenging, revealing, and informing the broader artistic, social, cultural, technological, and environmental issues confronting the built environment and architectural practice. Thesis advisors support the construction of specific methods of research focusing on each student?s particular interests, using the resources available throughout SAIC, the city of Chicago, global architecture schools, and emerging practices of architecture and design. The courses require multiple public reviews, student forums, exhibit curation, a thesis prospectus, an installation in the annual Design Show, and a comprehensive documentation of the work for entry in the Flaxman Library Archive. This studio seminar course focuses on research, exploration, experimentation, speculation, and documentation, as students investigate and identify strategies for their thesis projects. The class will review a number of readings that introduce students to research and thesis work in the field. Students then identify a research topic, along with the theoretical and methodological approaches that will demonstrate the relevance of their investigation to contemporary architectural discourses and practices. Student research will include genealogies, annotated bibliographies, and investigations that lead to a thesis proposal. The proposal, which must be approved by thesis faculty to pass the course and participate in the spring thesis studio, includes the following: a thesis statement; a cogent defense of a position relative to the statement; a succinct, well-organized, and substantive body of research using appropriate research methods; and an innovative proposal or strategy for developing a creative project. This Spring THESIS studio course asks students to develop their thesis proposal into an architectural process. Students expand their thesis proposal by experimenting with a variety of scenarios for installation at the annual Design show. Students pursue digital and physical construction of ideas, planning, designing, and installing their work in public. Weekly charrettes, discussions, public presentations, academic reviews, Grad Critique Week participation, competitions, and award entries offer students multiple venues for professionalizing and disseminating their work. After the close of the annual Design Show, students prepare a comprehensive documentation of their thesis work for faculty approval and inclusion in the Flaxman Digital Archive..Thesis studio asks students to determine and research an original problem with pertinent issues, and design an innovative response to some aspect of architectural production. Course Goals and Objectives 1) Give individual students the opportunity to discover, define, and research a significant aspect of architectural production in depth. 2) Develop a personal approach to an important issue of contemporary significance to the field of architecture and communicate it concisely. 3) Work with originality, clarity, and high production values at the end of an architectural education..Covers integrated construction systems, the design of structural forms, truss analysis, long span structures, lateral systems, steel and concrete member design, and an ARE refresher. Course Goals and Objectives 1) Understanding of the role that structural considerations play in design decisions. 2) Guide a team through the design process, communicate critical design information to structural consultants and integrate structural drawings and specifications into project documentation. 3) Develop skills to evaluate the pros and cons of structural systems and materials during pre-design. 4) Explores the code-prescribed design methods applied by the professional community. 5) Introduce best practices for structural system layouts for multiple typographies with a focus on performance-based design. 6) Introduces reference materials from organizations responsible for sharing information about the latest structural technologies and tools for their implementation. 7) Refresh the understanding of structural principles required to study for the ARE exam..Studies the Architectural profession, addressing legal and ethical issues, public health and safety, leadership, architect's and client's role, office costs and organization, and building cost estimation. Course Goals and Objectives 1) Discover and examine contemporary models of architecture practice. Prepare students to anticipate and navigate the complexity of establishing a nimble and purposeful design practice. 2) Understand the logistics of practice, strategies and processes of operating a business, pursuing commissions, negotiating contracts and managing a project during design & construction. 3) Learn to use basic building cost estimation methods..The Intermediate Design Studio in the accredited professional graduate degree emphasizes the capacity of buildings, interior space and urban interiors to engage and make tangible the opportunities inherent to diversity, change and the temporal occupation of space and time. Course Goals and Objectives include developing an understanding of how diversity and temporal or contingent conditions inform architectural space making, form and program. These questions are explored through the design or adaptive re-use of a medium sized building accommodating 100 occupants, sited in a culturally diverse and historically complex context. The design exploration needs to provide evidence of a deep understanding of the ethical and social responsibilities of the architect, of human behavior in a context governed by diversity and change and translated into a design proposition of a contextually sensitive building ? while addressing site conditions, accessibility, building services and systems and user well-being. Student performance criteria (SPC) that address the most recent National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB) requirements will be highlighted and form part of the coursework outcomes. Readings, textual and visual case studies and site visits will vary, but always provide the background and theoretical grounding for the site and project analysis and final project development and representation. Project work is a cumulative archive of the process of problem analysis and design exploration that are translations of observations, facts and ideas ? all being made visible through diagrams, drawings and models. Parts of the semesters work will be conducted in groups and which will contribute to individual project work presented in a final critique..As the second studio in the MDDO graduate sequence, this course gives students the opportunity to develop their skills in individual project development and form-giving while practicing the use of research and design tools. The primary purpose of this studio is to help students identify their individual motivations as designers by working on a self-defined design project within a structured iterative design process. As a complement to this inquiry, in-class presentations, readings, and discussions will familiarize students with the landscape of contemporary design practice. Readings will include theoretical, historical and critical texts. Design as a process will also be discussed. Students can expect to complete a multi-stage semester long project. You must be a Master of Design in Designed Objects student to enroll in this course..Designed Objects Prototyping Methods Lab (DOPML) is a technical practice class that uses a very narrow definition of ?prototype?. The class will not seek to explore and categorize an expansive collection of prototyping approaches. Rather, DOPML will support the making of prototypes and the development of skill with sensing and actuation within student practices. The class will initiate and / or support micro controller based prototyping using the Arduino hardware and software environment with the goal of greatly increasing the set media, processes, actions, events, data and information that can be used as ?material? for object design. The term ?object? can refer to a discrete physical thing in the world or some distinct component within an abstract system. In both scenarios it?s becoming increasingly common for an object to act as an interface between two states - commonly a control interface where input actions or data are connected to output actions or information. To experiment with this kind of interactivity, electronic prototyping offers a rich and ever-expanding collection of accessible tools and processes for designers to explore component systems (sensors and actuators) within creative practice. Throughout the semester, we will review and discuss the work of a number of artists, designers, and technologists that challenge traditional notions of 'making' in an age of significant and pervasive technological change. The primary component of this course will be to learn to use the Arduino hardware / software environment and develop basic data manipulation facility to develop prototypes that define and collect input (of all sorts) and create and control output (of all sorts). Increasing in complexity, this effort will be informed by a series of small projects designed to learn fundamentals. At mid-semester, students will required to propose a project of significant merit that will be developed throughout the remainder of the term..In the final thesis studio, students confirm and materialize their position and voice as designers by completing their self-selected thesis project initiated in DES OB 6150 -- Thesis Studio 1.Through an intensive period of seminar and tutorial discussion, prototyping, presentation and critique, students produce highly developed designed objects, systems, and experiences that critically engage specific areas of design, technology, and culture. Emphasis is given to determining potent vehicles through which the instance of the thesis is tested, exhibited and engages public consciousness. The course culminates in a thesis defense and the presentation of a final thesis project at the SAIC Design Show. You must be a Master of Design in Designed Objects Student to enroll in this course..Life after design school could reveal vast diversity beyond traditional employment opportunities, such as working for a design consultancy, as an in-house designer, or independently. Positioning Methods Lab is designed to help students shape their portfolio into various formats, focusing primarily on each students? specific future goals, and establishing a promotional strategy that feels authentic and attuned to their personal form of world-making. Readings and screenings will vary but will include foundational and instructional readings such as: Elements of Typographic Style by Bringhurst Grid Systems/Raster Systeme by Josef Muller-Brockmann The Crystal Goblet by Beatrice Ward On Punctuation by Gertrude Stein My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? by Laurel Schwulst As well as an introduction to various tools and resources such as: Are.na, Cargo Collective, the SAIC Service Bureau, the SAIC Writing Center, and various file formats and structure for print and web. In addition to completing weekly assignments and readings, students should expect to finish the class with a resume, portfolio in either printed or PDF form, as well as a personal website of work..The Intermediate Design Studio in the accredited professional graduate degree emphasizes the capacity of buildings, interior space and urban interiors to engage and make tangible the opportunities inherent to diversity, change and the temporal occupation of space and time. Course Goals and Objectives include developing an understanding of how diversity and temporal or contingent conditions inform architectural space making, form and program. These questions are explored through the design or adaptive re-use of a medium sized building accommodating 100 occupants, sited in a culturally diverse and historically complex context. The design exploration needs to provide evidence of a deep understanding of the ethical and social responsibilities of the architect, of human behavior in a context governed by diversity and change and translated into a design proposition of a contextually sensitive building ? while addressing site conditions, accessibility, building services and systems and user well-being.

The ephemeral conditions which light produces actually changes and alters the spaces we inhabit daily. The course Light & Space is designed to develop and expand both artistic and architectural sensibilities for students in the exploration of natural and artificial light as a medium. This one day a week studio is structured around a series of lectures about the comparison between Architects and Artists through exercises involving both physical and digital models within the city of Chicago. The exercises will introduce students on how to construct and assemble spaces in order to control light and the effects it has on inhabitants of architectural surroundings. The instructors of Light & Space present a series of case study comparisons between architects and artists as a means to open the possibilities for extreme experimentation within the studio setting. Students final project of the semester is the curation of the collection of imagery designed and rendered via all exercises, but open ended for each individual student?s interpretation and personal expression of social, political, and gender issues, etc. This course requires students to have a laptop that meets SAIC's minimum hardware specs and runs the AIADO template..This studio explores the use and significance of materials in architecture and interior architecture.

This course requires students to have a laptop that meets SAIC's minimum hardware specs and runs the AIADO template..This two-day core undergraduate design studio focuses on the role of the designer in public life, and the role architecture plays in shaping public life. Students address the legal, ethical, cultural, and political concerns that shape architecture practice through the development of a design project. Students use rigorous representation techniques, achieving a professional level of presentation. Students are expected to complete a professional portfolio and resume, along with their design work. This studio examines issues of program, structure, and building skin to identify how public architecture represents itself as a cultural and political artifact. Rather than understanding architecture as autonomous from its social, cultural, and political environment, the studio posits that architecture must be integrated into the world, be informed by and transforming the social and technical systems that enable our built environments. Students will review and study design approaches to expand their understanding of possibilities about new spatial dynamics informed by emerging social relationships, hybrid conditions and the social shaping of technology. Readings, textual and visual case studies and site visits will vary, but always provide the background and theoretical grounding for the site and project analysis and final project development and portfolio presentation. Project work is a cumulative archive of the process of problem analysis and design exploration that are translations of observations, facts and ideas ? all being made visible through diagrams, drawings and models. Parts of the semesters work will be conducted in groups, in group discussions and workshops and/or site visits; and which will all contribute to individual project work and portfolio development to be presented in a final critique. This course requires students to have a laptop that meets SAIC's minimum hardware specs and runs the AIADO template..This seminar will explore definitions and characteristics of interiority, historically and theoretically. It is not a survey of interiors but an exploration of the condition of interiority, physically, experientially and culturally. Physically, interiority is the product of boundaries and the tension of boundaries defined; experientially we spend the majority of our lives 'inside'. Culturally and psychologically, it implies habitation, the way we exist within inhabited space, how we negotiate boundedness and openness and the relationship between ourselves and spaces. The seminar will examine these conditions, looking particularly at the challenges to the notion of the interior offered by new technologies. The course will be conducted as an open seminar with presentations by faculty and students, and will form a basis for the self-development of critical and analytical skills in terms of exploring interior spaces, both literally and metaphorically..This one-day 3cr core design studio focuses on an architecture and interior architecture capstone project leading to the full-scale installation and exhibition designed and built by students. Students design, prototype and mount their own installation and exhibition piece, in collaboration with an organization or enterprise who gives them a prompt and space requirements.

It is intended for those who wish to work in the technical area of museums and with collectors. Collections managers typically focus on registration methods in large museums, but in smaller museums, these professionals might hold simultaneous positions as curators and/or directors. In the for-profit arena registrars work in galleries, auction houses, shipping and insurance companies, with private collectors or own their own business. Students will be exposed to all areas of collection management, from acquisition (accessioning) to de-acquisition (deaccessioning), care for a variety of types of objects, and external influences such as storage, environmental influences, shipping and insurance, and valuation. The main textbook will be Museum Registration Methods - the industry touchstone for collections managers. Timely articles and YouTube screenings will also be introduced with ongoing discussions of ?best practices? as illustrated by a variety of museum Collection Management Policies, Loan Agreements, and Artist Commission contracts. Coursework will include in-class assignments, relevant readings and two projects..The Management Studio is a space in which to explore 21st century management environments though a practice based investigation of contemporary organizational, project, and leadership models with an eye toward designing frameworks for the future. In addition to investigating so-called traditional management models, students will engage with current cultural management theory and practice around strategic planning, budgeting and capitalization, evaluation, communication strategy, digital communication, public relations, and fundraising (grant writing, individual donors, presentation skills). A distinguishing element of this course is the project-based learning environment. Management Studio integrates skill building projects into the course work for the purpose of practicing and developing individual and groups strategies and approaches to managing change/adaptation and cultural programming; supporting and engaging creativity; leading complex environments; building and understanding networks and connectivity; navigating teamwork, collaboration, self-organization, and problem-solving; and developing innovation practice skills. The projects in the studio are developed with external and internal partners and engage a broad set of skill building opportunities. Students select projects based on interest and a broad set of skill development opportunities. Management Studio II focuses on skills building in the areas of strategy and planning; resource development; working with artists; evaluation and data management; and communication strategy. In addition to team projects, there will be opportunities to cultivate individual concepts. The premise of this course is that participants will be active leaders in shaping the future of cultural/arts management. As such, the course invites broad and active participation and preparation for every class meeting. As a ?hands on? examination of management practice and theory, students are urged to critically engage with the material and to participate in class discussions, projects, presentations and debates. Each student will work on an ongoing project(s) in addition to class preparation to include reading, discussion and presentation. The willingness and ability to collaborate and continue to develop skills in team-based work is an essential element of this course and a core component of grading. Class will generally be divided into two sections or function as workshops. The first section will include workshops and discussions/presentations The second section will include project report outs and project work/discussion. Each project will be developed through the workshops as real time case studies..Exhibitions Incubator will provide an opportunity for students to research, write and execute exhibitions proposals with in the context of peer review and feedback. The process will include ideation, bibliographic research, writing and honing exhibition narratives, layout and space planning, and the writing of didactic texts. If the production of an exhibition can be compared to the scholarly work of essays or articles, the goal here is to become more experienced, comfortable and adept in researching and developing exhibitions that represent the production of new, original knowledge within the field. Readings will vary, but will typically include recent and historic exhibitions texts, and reference articles for curatorial writing and research. Some reading examples include, 'Wall Text,' by Ingrid Shaeffer and 'You Talking To Me? On Curating Group Shows that Give You a Chance to Join the Group' by Ralph Rugoff in 'What Makes a Great Exhibition.' Also, 'Notes Towards a History of the Solo Exhibition,' by Jo?o Ribas (Afterall); Instructional readings will include select chapters from 'How to Write About Contemporary Art,' by Gilda Williams. Some example of primary curatorial writing assigned include essays from the 2014 Whitney Biennial catalog, and 'Domino Effect' by Hamza Walker--they will be assigned weekly, and organized thematically and according to approach. Coursework will vary but will typically include readings, and scheduled deliverables (exhibition proposal drafts, annotated bibliography, sketch up drafts of exhibition layouts) and culminate in a final exhibition package that includes an extended curatorial statement, annotated bibliography, exhibition sketch-up plan, and didactic files..Law, Politics And The Arts provides the student with an understanding of the legal system and the political process as they relate to the arts. The first part of the course is a survey of the American legal system and laws affecting artists and arts organizations, including topics such as contracts, corporations, copyrights, and First Amendment issues. The second part of the course explores the philosophical foundations and the practical experience of the relationship of government and the political process to the arts, with an emphasis on advocacy and the skills to change the rules. Readings will include judicial opinions, legislation, and excerpts from both fiction and non-fiction works. We will look at US Supreme Court rulings on the limits of the First Amendment as well as statutes protecting artists from hazardous paints and unscrupulous gallery owners. Readings are selected to be accessible to the general reader. Assignments include weekly readings, both within the syllabus and those brought in by students readings, several quizzes, and two written assignments including a practical advocacy project..For spring 2023, the course in Digital Arts Administration will be curated around issues of Media Justice. In 2002, Malkia Devich Cyril, co-founder of the media Justice Network, helped coin the term Media Justice, and in 2019 declared that one significant goal of the Media Justice movement was to fight for a future where we are all connected, represented and free. Inspired by Malkias work, these are questions we will ask, together with invited guests and speakers who will contribute global and local perspectives: How can technology and design be decolonial, local and ethical? How do media literacy and technology education factor in the fight for social, political, and economic equality? How is Net Neutrality intertwined with racial, economic, and gender justice issues? What are the social implications and harms of artificial intelligence (algorithmic justice)? How do issues of Media Justice intersect with artistic practices? How do artistic and administrative digital practices relate to cultural policy processes? General Description: Arts Administration has increasingly intersected with topics in the digital realm, including copyright, archiving and data management, communication, education and access, in addition to displaying and maintaining the work by artists who work with electronic devices. Most recently, on-line platforms for museums and event venues have become crucial necessities. Technology rapidly changes, as do the needs it addresses and creates. For this reason, this topics class will choose a relevant area within Digital Arts Administration for each iteration. Course work will include readings and screenings, responses to presentations by invited experts, and an independent, individual or group research project appropriate to the annual topic of the course..In this course, students will survey, analyze and develop experimental curatorial models. Discussion will include actual and virtual, local, national and international curatorial practices that have the capability to shift or occur outside of institutional boundaries. Students will have the opportunity to propose, develop, critically back up, and explore experimental models. Experimentation may revolve around participants' roles, location, materiality, media and technology, spatial and temporal extension, funding approaches, aesthetic, social and political criticality and other topics. Work resulting from this course may be a critical study, a plan, a grant application, projects in progress, fully implemented concepts, or a combination of those options..Building on ARTSAD 5005, Activating Arts Administration: Key Frameworks, ARTSAD 6018, Spheres of Cultural Valuation, focuses on the exploration of cultural policy, projects, agencies, organizations and institutions that comprise global arts ecosystems, while also probing their foundational socio-political, economic and philosophical narratives, along with current and evolving rationales. Material will be developed through visiting speakers working with and for internationally operating cultural organizations; through readings in Arts Administration adjacent areas such as Anthropology, Critical Theory, Cultural Diplomacy, Gender Studies, Indigenous Studies, Performance Studies, Political Science and Sociology; and through individual and group research projects that explore student selected cultural policy examples across regions of the globe.

Reflecting on our current gig economy, we know that artists have always been considered the original gig workers tasked with managing an active studio practice, alongside multiple jobs and projects. DIY: Self-Management for Artists looks to the inherent management tools embodied in artistic practice, as a theoretical and practical framework to apply toward managing a sustainable and purposeful professional and personal life. This class will explore listening and critical feedback, project development and management, marketing and branding strategy, strategic planning, negotiation, building and maintaining networks, and portfolio development. Readings will vary, and include articles and excerpts from: How to do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy by Jenny Odell, The Art of Gathering: How we Meet and Why it Matters by Priya Parker, Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action by Simon Sinek, Critical Response Process: A Method for Getting Useful Feedback on Anything you Make from Dance to Dessert by Liz Lerman; The Artist?s Guide: How to Make a Living Doing What You Love by Jackie Battenfield, Making: Your Life as an Artist by Andrew Simonet, Living and Sustaining a Creative Life: Essays by 40 Working Artists by Sharon.Loudon Course work will vary but will include readings and critical writing responses throughout the semester, the development of a written project scope, regular class presentations and a final project on one aspect of a student's portfolio..This course will examine the many issues and contexts surrounding what it means to be an artist today. We will consider the multiple positions of the artist in contemporary culture, their relationships to their audience(s) and to the market, and closely examine major themes and strategies in contemporary art-making. Students will further investigate and articulate their own practice and its relationship to larger creative and cultural structures to contextualize their own goals and desires for their work. What does it mean to be an artist at this moment in time? This is the fundamental and critical question of the course, and as the course proceeds, will yield a broad and diverse range of responses. We will be reading excerpts from Ways of Seeing, John Berger; ?What Art Is and Where it Belongs,? Paul Chan; and Carter Ratcliff. Additional readings and videos will be topical, and come from current sources as the New York Times, ArtNews, Artforum, The Guardian, Aperture, the NewYorker, Interview Magazine, Artnet, Hyperallergic, the Observer and Jsonline. The class consists of discussions of current readings and videos on contemporary artists, exhibitions, and themes, visits to gallery and museums, guest speakers, and student presentations. Each student will lead a discussion on selected contemporary artists and specific readings from our class syllabus. Students present their work at the beginning of the semester and the end, create an artist statement, artist bio, and a Powerpoint presentation on their work in relation to the artists and topics discussed in class. This class is driven by discussions and each student's full participation is expected..This course is a multidisciplinary seminar that will present strategies for developing and sustaining your own studio practice and help prepare you for life after art school. It will provide practical instruction in getting started on and succeeding with your career after graduation and help you gain a critical understanding of your own artwork or creative endeavor and it's relationship to the larger cultural moment. The student will have the opportunity to create a cohesive body of work or curatorial project specific to each individual student's interest. Additionally, we will examine art historical precedents, contemporary ideas and practices in the art world, and the role of the artist in contemporary culture. The textbook for the class is Art/Work-Everything You Need to Know (and Do) as you Pursue your Art Career, Heather Darcy Bhandari and Jonathan Melber, in addition to readings from current sources, such as Artforum, Art News, New York Times, etc. The student will propose a project that he or she will complete over the course of the semester (which can include preparation for the BFA Exhibition.)The class will include readings and discussions, individual presentations, writing an artist's statement, resume, and cover letter, press release and exhibition announcements, project proposal, and discussions with visiting artists and curators, gallery and museum visits, and class critiques.

Students will design projects that respond specifically to the missions, challenges and ongoing needs of one or more collection..Exhibitions Incubator will provide an opportunity for students to research, write and execute exhibitions proposals with in the context of peer review and feedback. The process will include ideation, bibliographic research, writing and honing exhibition narratives, layout and space planning, and the writing of didactic texts. If the production of an exhibition can be compared to the scholarly work of essays or articles, the goal here is to become more experienced, comfortable and adept in researching and developing exhibitions that represent the production of new, original knowledge within the field. Readings will vary, but will typically include recent and historic exhibitions texts, and reference articles for curatorial writing and research. Some reading examples include, 'Wall Text,' by Ingrid Shaeffer and 'You Talking To Me? On Curating Group Shows that Give You a Chance to Join the Group' by Ralph Rugoff in 'What Makes a Great Exhibition.' Also, 'Notes Towards a History of the Solo Exhibition,' by Jo?o Ribas (Afterall); Instructional readings will include select chapters from 'How to Write About Contemporary Art,' by Gilda Williams. Some example of primary curatorial writing assigned include essays from the 2014 Whitney Biennial catalog, and 'Domino Effect' by Hamza Walker--they will be assigned weekly, and organized thematically and according to approach. Coursework will vary but will typically include readings, and scheduled deliverables (exhibition proposal drafts, annotated bibliography, sketch up drafts of exhibition layouts) and culminate in a final exhibition package that includes an extended curatorial statement, annotated bibliography, exhibition sketch-up plan, and didactic files..This interdisciplinary course draws from arts administration and policy and art therapy and counseling to critically examine social practice and research justice, arts and cultural curation, and community care work. This course will be held at the SAIC Homan Square campus. Through an introduction to an ecological approach, learners will engage various creative healing praxes (reflection + action) to deepen self-reflexivity while working alongside community: social practice artists, organizers, and wellness practitioners. Off-campus experiential research and collaborative community practice, predominantly in Chicago?s North Lawndale neighborhood, are key aspects of this course. Additionally, graduate-level art therapy and counseling students in this course will examine current topics and trends in the field of art therapy, special needs of a diverse range of populations, including diverse methodologies of practice as they relate to art therapy and counseling. Issues pertaining to the art therapist in specialized settings are explored. Content for reading and assignments will consist of assessment and evaluation, community counseling theory and clinical applications, social justice advocacy, issues of race and racism, relational community organizing, and community-engaged research (PAR)..We all have something that we do to offset stress and practice care for the self, be it jogging, knitting, reading, or meeting with friends. Care is a radical action. This course will look at care for the individual and care for the community as a strategy for art-making in the studio. Students will discuss self-care strategies that work for them and bring those strategies into the studio. The culminating project will be presenting a plan of action for continued self-care at SAIC and beyond with concrete examples of these strategies at play in the student's studio work. Students will work on a series of small sample projects throughout the semester in preparation for a final presentation of a finished piece. We will look to alternative models of evaluation and build our own unique dynamic approach to critiquing these pieces. Students will practice self-care by participating in the class reading group to discuss texts including All About Love by Bell Hooks, Emergent Strategy by Adrienne Marie Brown, Conversation with Mike Kelley, Keith Harring's Journals, Eva Hesse's notes and more. Texts will be selected to best reflect the student's interests and studio practices. We will look at artists and practitioners who bring care into their work across disciplines including Shana Moulton (film and performance), Aram Han Sifuentes (craft and participation), H. Melt (poetry and writing), Adrian Piper (research) and more. Students will be asked to contribute significantly to an extended bibliography of care for the class to share beyond the Spring semester. This course includes weekly text discussions, small group critiques on sample pieces and culminates in a full class critique of a self directed final project. Ideas for this project will be supported through individual meetings with the instructor and visiting guest self care experts..This course will prepare students for developing project proposals in various contexts ranging from informal collaborations with artist run spaces to formal grant applications. We will focus not only the process of conceptualizing a project idea and persuasively organizing the necessary content around it, but also explore the pragmatic aspects of carrying it out and interfacing collaboratively with an art space, an institution, or other artists. In addition to workshopping the various elements needed for a hypothetical project, students will be required to conceptualize, propose and execute a proposal of some scale at the end of the semester to put into practice the skills and ideas explored in the course. In doing so, we will use the project proposal as a means to understand the broader ecosystem of the artworld and the different roles people play within them: artist, curator, programmer, institution, non-profit infrastructure, commercial and corporate factors, and more. Chicago?s landscape of artists, institutions and DIY spaces will provide ample case studies and first hand know-how for us to tap into as we build an understanding of the interrelationships between an artistic practice and the space within which it is presented or contextualized..This interdisciplinary seminar introduces, deepens and extends writing skills and helps to develop concepts that can sustain, guide and propel artistic practice after graduation. Central to the class is the professional completion of two grant applications, followed by a mock jury event that simulates actual jurying procedure. In conjunction with the applications, students write artist statements and develop project proposals. We also discuss how the arts and the public intersect, whether in popular opinion, historic context or professional settings. This includes an assessment of the relations of artists and audiences, artists and administrators and curators, and artists and critics..In this course, students will analyze and report on art world and cultural ecologies and explore professional work opportunities while reflecting on their current creative and scholarly interests. The course will lead to an expanded understanding of professional opportunities and the tools to pursue them while starting to identify each of our strengths and interests in identifying possible pathways for our lives that include (work life - studio life - love - finances - passion - family - etc...). Toward the end of the semester, as a way to bring into practice what was covered in the course, each studen",2

Students will also generate a press kit for their project..Intermediate Screenwriting expands upon the skills learned in Beginning Screenwriting while preparing certain students for the longer-form writing required in Advanced Screenwriting. The purpose of the course is to allow students to develop mid-length stand-alone screenplays, adaptations from short stories or pilots for television series, while paying special attention to the vital role that drafting plays in the development of a successful script. Since Intermediate Screenwriting is first and foremost a writing class, there will be no formal reading or viewing assignments. However, throughout the semester, the professor will suggest books and articles to read and films to watch, that should help further and develop the various ideas that students are wrestling with in their scripts. For example, a work such as Kieslowski's ''The Decalogue'' will be suggested for students looking to embrace a thematic approach to a series of short films. Students have the option of completing two drafts of a 60-page script or three drafts of a 30-45 page script. Completion of these drafts are required to pass the class.This course explores the aesthetic, social and political implications of blurring the border between documentary and fiction filmmaking. The class offers a context for producing and critiquing student work, and provides a historical/critical grounding in examining work of cinema vrit, experimental narrative, autofiction, parafiction as well as the documentary turn in contemporary art.

Drawings on paper are scanned into Toon-Boom Studio for digital cell production. Time is spent on creating backgrounds and camera moves in the program. Some Knowledge of Final-Cut Pro, After Effects or Flash is recommended..Advanced Screenwriting is designed for students who have completed Beginning Screenwriting, or its equivalent, and are interested in pursuing the art and craft of feature-length screenwriting. The entire semester will be devoted to the completion of the first draft of one feature-length script by each student. All ten students in the class will be working on their own individual scripts, and by reading them aloud during class in a workshop structure, complete with post-reading discussion, it will allow students to participate in the creation of not just one, but ten, feature-length scripts. Since Advanced Screenwriting is first and foremost a writing class, requiring copious amounts of scripting and drafting, there will be no formal reading or viewing assignments. However, throughout the semester, the professor will recommend books or films that will assist in the development or completion of the students' first drafts. For instance, a film such as Aki Kaurismaki's 'Ariel' will be referenced as an example of how to develop powerful themes in a relatively short amount of screen time. Students are required to complete the first draft of a feature-length screenplay, approximately 90-110 pages. Completion of the draft, and a final thumbs-up by the teacher, are required to pass the course..The class is designed as an advanced independent project for students who have taken Handmade Cinema to further enhance and develop their work involving motion picture and moving image processing and mechanisms.

SAIC,Historic Preservation,"This course looks at the range of concerns that inform and shape the making as well as the reception of paintings in a contemporary context. As a class, we will read, discuss and debate a range of historical and contemporary texts by artists, art historians, cultural theorists and critics on the continuing role and impact of painting as an art form, market force, and culture shaper, along with readings addressing the ability of art --and of painting in particular-- to effect political, ethical, and psychic change on both an individual and a broader social and cultural level. Thematic topics, readings and screenings will vary but are typically chosen in reference to specific VAP or Departmental artist lectures offered during the semester of the course. Readings/topics may relate to one or more of the following: disability theory and the relationship of art to self-care; the relationship of visibility politics to current impulses in painting; the relationship of art to work, labor and leisure; the case of 'zombie formalism' and market effects on painting trends; the role of autobiography in art making and painting practices in particular. Mandatory individual studio critiques of 45-60 minutes each; weekly written outlines/quick bullet-point responses to one or more class readings; mandatory attendance to VAP lectures and other lectures if scheduled at same time as seminar class; final paper consisting of a critical review of a painting exhibition currently on view in Chicago..This graduate level studio seminar course is a hybrid of reading, discussion, making and critique, designed to pursue positions in historical and contemporary philosophy, critical analysis, and current thought relevant to photography and visual literacy. Throughout the semester, the course aims to explore the past and future of visual media and to look at its discourse in relation to life as an artist in the greater realm of culture, society and politics. Course programming includes critical readings, short and informal writing assignments, work and research presentations..In our ever-changing (media) landscape, the (media) artist must not only make the artwork, but also find ways for the artwork to enter the world, master the institutional procedures to make its life public, think as an entrepreneur and organizer, build a community and professional network. As technology and institutional frameworks keep changing, these endgame strategies are in constant flux. This class will point the way towards- and discuss solutions. Four main areas of study will be detailed: -finishing the work; -negotiating media and exhibition/publishing contexts; working with institutions, curators, and writers; -community building and -awareness of preservation of art work, especially in regards to (ephemeral) electronic media. A series of guests, both curators, critics and working artists, will be sharing their insights and positions and offer advise..Since the early 1960s the social impact of computer technology has been a dominant issue and since the early 1980s the digital revolution has been provoking profound changes in the way we live. Now, as we move into the twenty-first century, we realize that the next frontier of artistic and technological investigation is biology. The field of biological studies is changing from a life science into an information science. Biosemiotics, for example, is an interdisciplinary science that studies communication and signification in living systems. Biotechnologies are introducing complex ethical issues, such as the patenting and sale of genes. Genetic engineering is transforming forever how society approaches the notion of 'life.' A few contemporary artists have been responding to this change and are already working with modified bacteria, interspecies communication, and hybridization techniques to redefine the boundaries between the artwork and living organisms. This seminar discusses the complex and fascinating relationship between biology and art in the larger context of related social, political, and ethical issues..The purpose of this course is to provide an informal critique situation where students from various disciplines meet once a week to present and discuss their work. The faculty leader facilitates the discussion, which is designed to help students articulate a critique of their own work as well as the work of other students..This seminar takes an audio-centric approach to cinema, emphasizing an integrative approach to sound design. Topics include audio post-production techniques, auditory perception, and strategies and theories of sound-to-moving image relationships. We will explore this topic working primarily from the ear outward, privileging the sonic as the core of this investigation. Presentations on auditory perception and the basic physics of sound will inform a hands-on study of studio techniques including recording, foley, voice and sound effects editing, equalization, dynamics processing, reverberation, and mixing via thorough instruction on the ProTools digital audio workstation. Readings on theories and strategies of sound and sound-image relationships, and screenings of cinema works in which sound plays a central role, will provide a diverse context for understanding and interrogating the audio-visual experience. Student work will be critiqued from the seminar?s audio-centric perspective. Works by Deborah Stratman, Lucrecia Martel, Francis Ford Coppola, Alain Resnais, Abigail Child, Gary Hill, Martin Scorsese, and others. Readings by Michel Chion, Rick Altman, Kaja Silverman, Clarice Lispector, Jean-Luc Nancy, Brian Kane, Trin T. Mihn-ha, and others..The purpose of this course is to provide an informal critique situation where students from various disciplines meet once a week to present and discuss their work.

The first portion of this class will be technically based to learn different modes of construction, mold making, as well as different glazing and firing techniques in ceramics. The second portion will be focused on independent projects, advising and critical discussions. Readings will be a combination of history of ceramics, contemporary artist, and technical information. Some of the contemporary artists using clay within contemporary art practice we will study in this course include Cannupa Hanska Luger, Elizabeth Jaeger, Woody De Othello, and more. There will be discussions on the history of ceramics and how contemporary artists use clay in performance, sculpture, design, architecture, and print media. Students should expect to produce a consistent body of work to be presented in a culminating course critique at the end of the session. Junior and Senior-level undergraduate students are welcome to enroll in this course and should email the instructor to seek authorization to register..This seminar focuses on developing a shared language for interdisciplinary critique, and on understanding one?s own work better through fine-tuning how you look and talk about each other's. We will proceed with the assumption that all artworks are by nature collectively authored in that they emerge from, and contribute to, the ongoing conversation of art. This is an interdisciplinary seminar consisting of studio visits informed by selected readings and discussions, short writing assignments, and one longer piece of writing related to your work. This class aims to help you deepen your relationship to your work, and to develop an ease with, and appetite for, theoretical discourse and critical dialogue to help sustain your practice in the long-term..This critique-based class addresses a wide range of issues as they arise through the direct experience of the students' work. Emphasis is given to the correlation between the declared artistic intent of each student and the reception of those intentions as they are embodied in the artwork. Special attention is paid to clarifying how students' work may be described, contextualized, and documented with the goal of developing a shared critical framework for evaluating a range of different disciplines and approaches that gives students a solid basis to proceed from effectively. The class places an emphasis on extensive experimentation related to studio problems and directions through individual idioms. This course approaches art with a focus on concept, idea, and language rather than percept and expressive intuition. Special reference to contemporary theory including art's use and function is foregrounded.

It will interpret artwork within contemporary and historical political and philosophical arguments. It will also address and evaluate specific modes of interpretation and critique, including forms shaped by institutional, intellectual, and in some cases vernacular histories. Active participation in discussions and in weekly critiques is expected. Class presentations on selected reading will also be required..This interdisciplinary seminar explores the use of the human voice in performance, sound art, text-based work, social practice, installation, etc. The root of our investigation is the voice as human utterance and material encounter, both live and mediated. We shall interrogate and experiment with the interaction of the voices semiotic and acoustic aspects, its potential to unite and rupture, and the aesthetic, situational, technological, gendered, racial, political, historical, and social aspects of text, language, voice, expression, and communication. Critiques of student work are supplemented by readings and screenings of works by artists, writers, historians, theorists, and linguists. Works by artists, writers, historians, theorists, and linguists include Sarah Hennies, Christine Sun Kim, Benjamin Lee Whorf, Mendi and Keith Obadike, Alessandro Bosetti, Norie Neumark, Clarice Lispector, The Last Poets, Jeanne Favret-Saada, Roland Barthes, Jaap Blonk, Pamela Z, Mladen Dolar, Douglas Kahn, Sarah Nooter, Frances Dyson, Gregory Whitehead, Daniela Cascella, F. T. Marinetti, Timothy Donaldson, Alfred Wohlfson, and others. All speech acts and vocalizations -- and the way those are listened to by others -- carry with them a panoply of cultural, gendered, historical and political implications, overtly or covertly. Thus, the topic is inherently one that embraces discourse on diversity, inclusion, identity, and power relations..Many of the most essential discourses of what we think of as contemporary art are rooted in an expanded concept of sculpture. This exit-seminar will encourage graduating students to contextualize their work within these discourses as they produce their MFA thesis projects. Professional-practice strategies are modeled, discussed and practiced in preparation for establishing a post-master?s career. This course is aimed at fourth-semester graduate students in Sculpture but will be of relevance for all graduate students in any department. Subjects are developed through conversation with visiting arts professionals, theoretical and practical readings, discussions and critiques of students work..Taken every semester, the Graduate Projects courses allow students to focus in private sessions on the development of their work.

SAIC,Liberal Arts,"In consultation with Study Abroad, undergraduate students may spend up to two semesters (30 credit hours) at approved partner schools, or at another Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) school in North America. Various types of credit can be earned depending on the host school?s offerings. Approval from Study Abroad is required. The process has two steps; the student first submits an application and portfolio to Study Abroad and it is reviewed by a faculty panel. If approved to proceed, the student then applies to the proposed host school. Information and resources about International Exchange, AICAD Exchange, and Tuition Transfer programs are available at Study Abroad..This course introduces the student to a wide spectrum of performance forms including performance in every day life, rituals, folk forms, artists' actions, experimental dance and theatre, activist performance, and intermedia forms. Students learn the history of performance practices, explore theoretical issues , and develop individual and collaborative works. Primarily a beginner's course but open to all levels of students..This class will focus on ephemerality and duration in live and mediated performance. Timings from our daily lives (circadian rhythms, status updates, the Groundhog-Day-like routines of life under quarantine?) will inspire micro-performance interventions, looping choreographies, nomadic performances, extreme durational work and collaborative projects. We'll excavate perceptions of speed through body-based exercises and writing, and investigate phenomena like fast twitch muscle fibers, high frequency trading and mass incarceration. Works by artists like Douglas Gordon, Sondra Perry, Tehching Hsieh and Anne Teresa de Keersmaker, and writings by Paul Virilio and Wendell Berry, will guide discussions about mobility, power, and the ecological implications of speed..Combining both medieval and contemporary performance practices, this class probes the possibilities of object and figure theater performance in the outdoor setting. This class will examine work such as the Renaissance spectacles of Piero di Cosimo, the Eastern European Happenings, the public ceremonies of Welfare State International and the street protest of Bread & Puppet Theater. Projects will focus on solo works as well as collaborations..Artists have used performance art to engage a variety of political issues through resistance practices that include protest art to public actions. In this course, we will examine the ways that artists have used their bodies to push, resist, intervene, mediate, respond, and deconstruct political concerns that take on a variety of issues from the private to the public. We will read a variety of texts that deal with matters of social inequality to citizenship, survival tactics to systemic violence. Students will create both individual and collective performance projects that respond to contemporary political concerns that are critical to their lives and art practice by using the body as a space of investigation and resistance..In this course we will focus on exploring methods and theories in relation to the idea of the document and documentary. The class will learn how to utilize practical methods of interdisciplinary performance as way of research into the documented. Readings and discussions will include Susan Sontage, Judith Butler, Carrie Lambert-Beatty, Carol Martin who will guide us to negotiate questions around narrative, ethics, performativity, and bureaucracy of the documented. We will visit various sites such as Video Data Bank, the John Flasch Artists Book Collection, and possibly more to observe specific works by artists such as Walid Raad, Adrian Piper, Rabih Mrou, Omer Fast, Emily Jacir, Maurizio Cattlelan, Lawrence Abu Hamdan and more. Students will re-perform, re-imagine, re-enact, investigate, respond, and discover possible / impossible ways towards the idea of the documented. The course will consist of individual and collective projects investigating a different area of documentary: 1) Biographical/Autobiographical 2) Archival/Historical 3) Immediate/Ethnographic field research..This seminar examines the concepts of the precarious and the ephemeral and their connections to imperceptibility. The title derives from the artist Adam Pendletons claim (after Deleuze and Guattari) to incompleteness as the most ethical form of art and being. It investigates the process of incompletion and how art can give the force of form to that incompletion. It will explore contemporary performance practices as they relate to the politics of imperceptibility, queer wildness, and the more than human. Students will study the creative strategies of counter-portraiture, spaces of disappearance, incompleteness, and lightness of action. The class draws from the writings of Deleuze and Guattari, Karen Barad, Peggy Phelan, Erin Manning, and Jack Halberstam and the creative work of artists Adam Pendleton, Jimmy Robert, Kent Monkman, and Dani Leventhal Restack. Course work includes the creation of two individual pieces, written creative and critical responses to the work of others, and weekly reading and writing responses..Students will explore how the body?s presence, movement and language was historically and is contemporarily used to frame, describe, subvert, and oppose normative expectations, legislation, and systems of power. Examining queerness and queer theory, students will explore how tactics of gender bending, shape shifting, flash mobbing, and protesting have been employed as performance acts in which the body becomes a subversive tool inciting dialogue. From Stonewall to Abu Ghraib, Judith Butler to Split Britches, students will learn the history of queered performance practices, and develop individual and collaborative works..What happens when the artwork that we make is so close to us that criticism is hard to take? As an audience, how do we provide feedback for work that comes from a place of personal experience? And how does one?s own identity as a viewer play into the interpretation and response to the work? In this course, we will engage with these questions, and come up with strategies to approach one another?s work with empathy and care while providing critical response. We will also consider how such work can be made the most poignant through a variety of strategies, including personae, humor, endurance, metaphor, trace, and site. The course will provide opportunities to present and get critical feedback on live work, and/or work that is personal in nature. While the focus of this course will be on embodied practices, it is open to all disciplines and areas of study. Studio assignments, readings, and writing projects are aimed to contextualize discussions around identity and the body, with particular attention to performance. We will look at artists that complicate and question the agency of the body, the performer, and the viewer, including: Santiago Sierra, Andrea Fraser, Vito Acconci, Clifford Owens, Ron Athey, Coco Fusco, Guillermo Gomez-Pe?a, Tino Sehgal, James Luna, Adrian Piper, Sharon Hayes, Tania Bruguera, Leigh Bowery, and Bob Flanagan. We will also read critical responses of these works to expand our own notions of critique..This interdisciplinary capstone, with an emphasis on contemporary photography and visual culture, is structured as an intensive critique and mentoring class focused on the development and presentation of culminating work at the end of the BFA and the continued progression of studio work beyond the BFA exhibition. The course supports the production of self-initiated work, a successful BFA show and a road map for a sustainable art practice after graduation. Preparations for the BFA exhibition include workshopping project proposals, budgets, production schedules, the development of new work and an array of possible final presentation forms. Readings, screenings and discussions will examine useful models of participation in cultural production and a critical framework for analyzing a range of platforms to share work online, in print and exhibition. Studio visits will provide insight into the day-to-day life of artists at various stages in their career ranging from current SAIC grad students to working professionals. Online and printed portfolios utilizing an ever-evolving archive of work will be refined along with professional supporting materials such as statements, CVs and artist talks necessary for a professional practice beyond graduation..This basic class, required for entry into all other photo classes, introduces contemporary technologies for producing photographic images. This course also introduces seeing, thinking and creating with a critical mind and eye to provide greater understanding of the construction and manipulation of photographic form and meaning. Approaching the medium in its current complex and pluralistic state, students explore a variety of photographic concepts and techniques. While various physical cameras are still in use today the fundamentals of using digital cameras, including manual exposure and lighting are stressed. Eclectic forms of output are explored in order to discover methods of presentation most suited to a particular idea. 'Knowledge of photography is just as important as that of the alphabet. The illiterate of the future will be a person ignorant of the use of the camera as well as the pen.' Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946). This course will address the complex and continual shifting nature of photography; what influences our understanding of how a photograph functions while exploring a diverse array of photographic genres and applications. Assignments will provide technical skills to use cameras, compose images and print digital photographs.

Additional readings and screenings will provide examples of historical and contemporary work created utilizing large format photography, and highlight the cameras meditative qualities and excellent resolution and control..Every idea has a medium most suited to its execution, but often not the one in which the artist is working. This class considers new ways of translating ideas into other media to develop a sense of possibilities beyond the straight photograph. Conceptual art has given us an understanding of the triggers that might provoke an investigation of layers of meaning within the simplest of ideas. Assignment encourage students to think beyond the usual way they work and include the use of collaboration, installation, audio, video, live feed, the internet, performance, and performative uses of photography..In photographic technology the term latent image means an invisible image produced by the exposure of the film to light. In a development process the latent image forms a visible, perceptible, and tangible image. By virtue of its ambiguous phenomenon, latent image is oscillating somewhere between visible and invisible and completely transparent - trapped in its being and physical appearance. It is there, but it exists in a zone, which is inaccessible to our senses, losing its essential foundation and immanent quality for its existence - visibility. Latent Image: Photosensitivity and Politics of the [In]Visible topic class focuses on the very existence and ontology of the photosensitive image. A visual and theoretical investigation of the photographic medium; its definition, its form, its boundaries. We will examine possibilities and limitations of a photosensitive record in various contexts, i.e.: materiality, technology, process, theory. Also, review selected threads in historical and contemporary discourse on photographic narratives and their meanings. Based on strong, yet open theoretical and visual research, this course emphasizes a research-based artistic practice. The studio component encourages students to experiment and develop skills in a variety of mediums, followed by realization of two independent long-term projects throughout the course of semester..In the conventions of still life painting, arrangements of everyday materials reflect on larger themes of temporality, death, the body, consumption, and commodity. The Still Life Image is a studio course taking an expansive view of the still life genre: seeking to explore its generative potential for contemporary photographic practice, while unpacking its relevance to dialogues around materiality, objecthood, and images in the digital age. This topics course is structured around core readings, the viewing and discussion of artworks, and the production of personal work. Course materials explore how traditional attitudes of the still life genre are being reimagined in contemporary practice, while providing frameworks from art history and contemporary theory. Each student will create a focused body of work over the course of this three-week summer intensive. Course structure and syllabus will be adjusted to the circumstances unfolding at the time of the class. This course is a space for innovation and creative approaches to both learning and making, in ways that are active and responsive to changing conditions..Class objectives are to provide students with an opportunity to work through the process of concept development, pre-production, fashion Styling, hair & markup, set design, location scouting, studio & natural lighting techniques, digital post production, and how to capture the essence of the fashion theme through tested photography techniques. Garment silhouette, cut & construction, color, pattern and texture are key elements given consideration to clearly communicate the fashion design idea using the most up-to-date and effective photographic techniques. Editorial Photography themes are used in collaboration with Fashion students garments and class photo shoots are used throughout the Fashion Departments annal award-winning the Book publication. Visits to professional fashion photographer studios, exhibition visits, and in-class lectures give students additional opportunities to discuss create and technical topics being used today in fashion photography. Application is required for consideration..The class will address the photographic book. we will investigate the numerous styles and how it influences meaning. we will question the limits of books where photography will be the main emphasis. this is not a class that will be primarily on structure we will not be making books beyond the most basic level. the quality and traits of print on demand publishing and visit with local publishers and editors will be arranged. an integral component of the class will be the chicago artist book fair. we will almost live in the joan flash artist book collection. the main text will be the structure of the visual book by keith smith. among courses that would work well in conjunction are - sequencing and structure and artist books..The Anthropocene is the name of the new geological epoch, first proposed by atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and marine biologist Eugene F. Stroemer in 2000, with the proposal that human species has become the single prominent agent of change affecting the earths geology and ecosystems. Since then, the conversations on the Anthropocene, climate change, sustainability and the planetary ecological crisis have proven that the extremely complex problems the Earth is facing can only be addressed by new forms of collaboration and innovative knowledge production. Photography plays in this context a pivotal role and goal of this class is to promote empirical and forensic work on landscapes of the Anthropocene, the degraded and damaged ecologies of the planet Earth. Collaborative work and access to different material forms, laboratories, analog and digital photographic media as well as scholarship and first-person testimony on health, race, politics and aesthetics, will help generate diverse perspectives on the entangled realities of the world and the complex human-natural systems. Questions of environmental justice and environmental ethics will take center stage in this class. Photography will help to transform cognition into experience and practice into cognition, making invisible processes available to our perception. There will be multiple excursions, meetings with artists, scholars and scientists, but also studio time and critiques..Advanced Post-Production and Fine Arts Printing refines and expands the digital imaging skills learned in previous classes. Emphasis is placed on all stages of production that occur after image acquisition and streamlining digital workflow and mastering advanced editing skills in preparation for creating exhibition-quality prints. Workflow techniques include advanced image correction, color management, and advanced masking methods. Photo manipulation approaches focus on using Photoshop and other photo editing software addons and programs as creative tools for exploring the conceptual applications of retouching, image compositing, color grading, and other post-production methodologies. This course utilizes a variety of technical assignments designed to build and reinforce digital skill-building. Students will progress through the technical material via structured assignments and the completion of self-conceived creative projects. Readings and discussions address contemporary theoretical issues surrounding digital imaging and the constant shift and development of new capabilities associated with digital output technologies.

Each course is designed to focus on a specific area of comics production. To learn more about the topic of a specific comics course in which you are interested, please review the course description for that particular class..Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy comics began as popular entertainment, intended to sell units on newsstands with lurid cover art and shocking story titles, but artists have always used the genres to investigate such complex topics as identity, illness and the body, and to lay bare the structural forces behind racism, sexism and political oppression. Students will read some classic works as well as a handful of contemporary pieces that use genre as a jumping-off point. Throughout the class, they will make a number of short comics that investigate contemporary life through the lens of the fantastic, to be collected and presented in the form of a printed zine..It can be easy for students to become so focused on the final product of art making that they lose sight of the importance of process. To that end, this studio class aims to encourage students to play and experiment within the medium of comics, creating projects with methods they wouldn?t normally use, and avoiding the urge to fall back on their usual or expected ways of working. Students will not need to worry about making a great piece of art, and instead can learn more about their own art practice and what does or doesn?t work for them. This class will look at a variety of artists, genres, and forms in the comics medium. The types of comics investigated may include everything from traditional superhero genre comics, to handmade art comics, graphic novels, abstract comics, newspaper gag comics, and even content that may or may not be considered comics, depending on how one defines ?comics.? Students will also be encouraged to share their favorite comics or whatever they?re currently reading, and to look into books and comics they aren?t familiar with. After casual critiquing of the previous week?s work, each class begins a new project or exercise that starts with a prompt or general parameters, which students use as starting points to follow in whatever direction interests them..This course explores nonfiction narratives told in the first person. Students will read and discuss examples of memoir, personal essay, journalism, and diary comics, as well as more experimental formats. Truth, point of view, and ethics will be examined, particularly in how they work along with storytelling, tone, style, and other formal aspects of comics. The work created by the students will vary broadly based on their interests and personalities, with the general goal of self-examination. Readings and guest artists will vary each semester. Selected readings include graphic novels and mini-comics that have been published recently by both large publishers and self-published by individual cartoonists. Skype visits allow students to ask questions of comics artists, critics, publishers, and distributors. Past guests have included artists Julia Wertz, Carta Monir, Summer Pierre, and John Porcellino, Lauren Weinstein, critic Rob Clough, and publisher Raighne of 2dcloud. Some additional artists that I often introduce are Gabrielle Bell, Vanessa Davis, Lisa Hanawalt, Sarah Gliddens, Karl Stevens, Kevin Budnik, Roz Chast, Cara Bean, and Liana Finck. Students will reproduce 16 copies of a 24 or more page comic, which will be distributed to the class during the final critique. They will complete one or more pages each week, which will be critiqued and discussed throughout the whole semester.

In this course, we will be exploring anatomy through the production of a three-dimensional ecorche - where students will use additive and subtractive sculptural practices to create a 1/3 life-sized sculpture representing half skeletal structure and half musculature form. Lectures and materials will focus on specific areas of the body..We speak through our bodies, and learn to read other's even before we use words. The figure runs through every culture's art. Even when we work purely abstractly, the figure lurks at the edges and dictates nearly every reference point. This studio aims to teach students how the body communicates, and facilitate its effective use in their work. Primarily a studio course, we will use images from art history, contemporary art, graphic novels, films and photography, as well as written material, as jumping-off points for long drawings in a variety of media. We will also go on a series of field trips to discuss how to read body language, and discuss its evolution through animal communication to the nuances of human interchange. This is an advanced studio..This drawing studio serves as a broad introduction to historical and contemporary drawing practices.

Structured classroom critiques will bring drawing concepts into personal student work..How big is big? Does the size of a drawing alter our ideas of what we?re about while we?re producing it? How do relationships of internal scale alter our sense of the surrounding space, and how do the sizes of the materials and the support alter our own awareness of scale? In this course we will explore the potential for large format drawing in the perceptual, material, narrative and conceptual senses. We will work towards expanding notions of Large, Format, Studio and Drawing. We will work towards specificity and developing each student's individual concerns. Bring your ambition, you'll need it. Most time in class will be spent working on studio projects, which will be supplemented by museum visits, slide lectures, student led reading discussions and presentations, and in depth critique. Readings and artists looked at will vary, but will typically include texts which attempt a broad overview of the state of drawing within the field of contemporary art like Vitamin D2 and Drawing Now: Eight Propositions, and include contemporary artists working with drawing at ambitious scale such as Toba Khedoori, Amy Sillman, and William Kentridge, and more historical examples like Willem de Kooning, Cy Twombly, Lee Krasner, and Jasper Johns. There will be a long form mid-term critique and a shorter final critique. Students will be expected to complete multiple large scale works for each..Studio Drawing: Fail Better is an exploration of time-based and ephemeral strategies as they relate to elements of drawing. Much like Baldessari's disowning of his early work, students will be encouraged to let go of practiced methods, using destruction as a form of creation. Doubt will be embraced, experimentation encouraged, and risk considered a viable game-plan. Employing strategies such as collage, archives, and documentation, we will explore how to rebuild your portfolio after you?ve let it go. Rebuilding strategies will range from accumulative, time-based methods such as the work of William Kentridge to the chaotic secretions of Dieter Roth. There will be studio problems and exercises, sketchbook assignments, and slide presentations with a focus on individual projects..This drawing studio serves as a broad introduction to historical and contemporary drawing practices.

SAIC,Masters in Fine Arts Low Residency,"Artists' Book & Indie Publishing | This is an opportunity to research and produce independent projects that grapple with the ideas, materials and forms of artists books and independent print publishing. Students regularly present their work for discussion and feedback, and participate in independent and small group tutorials as needed. Field trips to local archives, such as the Joan Flasch Artists Books Collection, the Ryerson Library and the Newberry Library augment our study. Course work includes active participation in workshops, the development of an annotated bibliography of artists books and related critical readings relevant to one's practice, and a final project. This course may assist the development of projects toward the MFA Thesis Exhibition and/or the material presentation of the MFAW thesis. Students from all disciplines are welcome..An interdisciplinary workshop for artists, designers and writers interested in working across disciplines to develop experimental work that engages text from multiple perspectives. Conceptual, poetic, political, and narrative models will be reviewed and discussed. Alternative strategies for citing and presenting text in public spaces will be explored. These might include billboards, projections, bus placards, broadsides, and performance works. The emphasis of the workshop is on collaboration and process. An exhibition produced by workshop participants is part of the class structure..A writer's creative output is not strictly limited to novels, poems, plays, stories, and other traditional literary forms, but may also include texts historically viewed as private documents: diaries, letters, personal reflections. In this class, we will consider these latter forms as literature unto themselves, along with interviews and public performances of the creative self, small-scale and large. We will focus on interviews and conversations by authors including James Baldwin, Lorraine Hansberry, David Foster Wallace, Bob Dylan, August Wilson, and Imogen Binnie. We will look at journals and letters by Samuel Beckett, Flannery O?Connor, Alice Walker, and Anais Nin, to examine how private writings and correspondences inform the creation of the artistic self. We will write our own journals and letters, and conduct and transcribe interviews with peers on the events of the day. This class is recommended for students with an interest in literary biography and ephemera, as well as experimental generative practices..In this course we will look into ways to write for performance and other ephemeral based practices from sound to video and new media. We will write for performance/video/sound; create content from alternative methods of scoring and storyboarding; and excavate object based works from our written materials to create tangible takeaways: artist books, sculpture, installations, drawings etc. Some scholars and artists that we will investigate are Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Okwui Okpokwasili, Blondell Cummings, Nam June Paik, Shirin Neshat, Martine Syms, Jenny Holzer, Kameelah Janan Rasheed, Pamela Z, Diane Severin Nguyen, Wu Tsang, Meriem Bennani, Salamishah Tillet, Xu Bing and many more. Students will be expected to engage with interdisciplinary ways of working with an emphasis on experimental writing practices - creating a final work using a medium of their choice..This workshop explores the notion that each piece of writing has its own needs. The writer's role, then, is to get out of the way and let the piece emerge. As memoirist and poet Patricia Hampl notes, it's a matter of paying attention to 'what it wants, not what I want.' With this in mind, writers/artists composing fiction, nonfiction, poetry and/or hybrid forms (e.g. text and image, blurring genres, or using video elements . . .) will have an opportunity to investigate not only the genesis of their work but also the choices made along the way to completion. Although the focus will be primarily on student work, we will examine readings from Pam Houston, A. Van Jordan, Maxine Hong Kingston, Joe Brainard, Justin Torres, Lia Purpura, among others. Assignments include in-class writing prompts, producing 3 different pieces for workshop/feedback sessions, reading and responding to each other's work, and giving an individual presentation on your process in relation to something generated for a workshop..Might there be a kind of poem that acts like a parasite latched on to a host body? A poem whose very life is the fusion of various sources, voices, discourses? This poetry workshop invites students to read and write poetry that, either overtly or subtly, engages with other texts or weaves together various discourses. Well examine ways that poems create intertextual relationships (e.g. quoting, voicing, alluding, echoing, stealing, sampling, imitating, translating) and test out these methods in our own writing. While the focus of the readings and exercises will mainly be on poetry, students writing prose, fiction, or hybrid genres are invited to join and work in their own genres. Afterall, the theoretical concept of intertextuality comes from Bakhtin's critical texts on Rablais and Dostoyevsky! Readings will likely sample older intertextual models (such as ballads), as well as modern and contemporary explorations, such as work by Ted Berrigan, Terrance Hayes, Rosmarie Waldrop, Jack Spicer, Maggie Nelson, and others..This graduate workshop will be a crash course in lessons from graphic design. Students will develop a working knowledge of typography and layout with the goal of working towards creating a design language sensibility in support of their writing practice. We will consider how artists and designers utilize various typographic, print and distribution methods. We will look at both manual and digital composing and printing processes including: letterpress, screenprinting, risograph, graffiti, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe InDesign. We will complete exercises in class and engage in research that generates knowledge around how type and layout can be manipulated to affect the reading of a work. Readings and screenings will vary but some artists and designers we will look to include: Experimental Jetset, Kameelah Janan Rasheed, Barbara Stauffacher Solomon, Errol Morris, Emory Douglas, Amos Kennedy, Barbara Kruger, Basquiat, Gloe One (Gloria Talamantes), Angela Davis Fegan, Gravillis Design, etc..This course examines writing formulated and structured according to systems of thought and expression. The nine trans-disciplinary system types presented in the class derive from various modes and technologies of language and presentation: abecedarium, collection, calendar, dialectic, experiment, lipogram, palimpsest, substitution, transposition. Case studies of system-based writing include works by Richard Powers, Andrea Rexilius, Gertrude Stein, Cesar Vallejo (tr. Joseph Mulligan), Renee Gladman, Arkadii Dragomoshchenko (tr. Ana Lucic and Shushan Avagyan), and Jay Wright. Further references include Jen Bervin, Ann Hamilton, Viktor Shklovsky, and Kenzaburo Oe. Each student will make two presentations during the semester: a primary presentation of work; a response (the following week) to the primary presentation of another; or a response to one of the readings. All presentations last a maximum 15 minutes, happen in the room, and involve language and the systems discourse in some way. Students also participate in three in-class writing sessions through the semester..Cross the street to the Art Institute and you will see easels set up before well-known paintings where, in an age-old practice, student artists are learning brush techniques, mimicking styles, practicing compositions they might never have imagined on their own. No matter how comfortable you are in your writing habits ? or because you arecomfortable ? imitation is a way to stretch your capacities and increase your versatility. Looking carefully at, and then imitating, challenging work enlarges your conception of the infinite variety of styles and structures available to you. This is an invitation to play, through brief weekly exercises, with the sentence, with the tone, organization,punctuation and formatting of many kinds of prose, appropriating what you can of their strategies. Our models will stretch from Swift and James to Woolf and Garcia Marquez (who will perhaps re-tell each other's stories in their own voices) to Anna Deveare Smith, Donald Barthelme, Evan Connell, Lorrie Moore, Junot Diaz and a long list of contrasting contemporary voices..Seminar: History of Comics & Graphic Novels | We are constantly writing and rewriting our own stories as we learn more about ourselves and the world around us. This course will attempt to create a map of human experiences and develop a chronology of comics that approach these topics throughout the semester. We will define history through experiences and stories shared by others, rather than establish a canon. Readings and discussions will be a central focus of this course. Some readings will be self-selected, and some will be assigned. Be prepared to be reading one or more comics/graphic novels a week. Selections will vary based on the interests of the class, but may include such comic giants as Art Speigelman, Marjane Satrapi, Will Eisner, Trove Jansson, Osama Tezuka, Jillian and Mariko Tamaki, George Herriman, Eleanor Davis, and more. Course work will be largely focused on cultivating our own lineages throughout the history of comics, critical analysis, and researching the connections between past and present. Students will be expected to maintain a voracious appetite in their readings and a self awareness in their own work..All writing begins with a writer. The writer alone, the writer entering a history of writers, the writer-child, the writer-citizen. Maya Angelou wrote: A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer. It sings because it has a song. In short it has an I Am. To own up to first person is not to claim supremacy and hierarchy, but to recognize life as a source, a fountain, an ecology. From which, through your senses, those receptors of attention, you enter in vibrant conversation. This is not a course in autobiography but you will explore your body, origins, processes, senses, dreams, Muses in an iterative fashion. Readings include poetry, fiction and nonfiction. Some artists we'll read are: Lynda Barry, Rita Dove, Stuart Dybek, Miranda July, Layli Long Soldier, Marc Richard, ZZ Packer, Leslie Jamison and David Whyte. They are our point of departure for analyzing techniques to create vibrant sensory images, shift from microscope to satellite narrative views, and enlarge our individual presence to include the Body Politic. Studio exercises will ask you to pull the world near to taste-test it, with synergy, inspiration, and playfulness. The Sophomore Seminar's Keystone Assignments are: DIY Future Project & Documentation of Practice. Your creative writing project 'This I Write' will receive an all-class workshop, for you to follow up with a re-vision..This class serves as an entry into the historical, theoretical and practical concerns of creative writing as an art form in itself and as a vital element of interdisciplinary projects. We explore the possibilities of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, plays and hybrid practices as writing for the page, as well as for performance, sound, installation, and image-based pieces. Students are assigned reading and writing exercises, and discuss each other's writing in workshop or small critique sessions..This class serves as an entry into the historical, theoretical and practical concerns of creative writing as an art form in itself and as a vital element of interdisciplinary projects.

Students are assigned reading and writing exercises, and discuss each other's writing in workshop or small critique sessions..This workshop operates from the premise that whether compelled by memory, gossip, witnessing, or revelation, people have a need to tell stories, and so we work on making the telling of our tales more resonant, purposeful, and entertaining. We draw from the short stories of Annie Proulx and Uwem Akpan, monologues of Suzan-Lori Parks, prose poems of Joe Wenderoth, essays of Toni Morrison and Virginia Woolf, the comedy of Hannah Gadsby, the investigative local podcast The Constant: A History of Getting Things Wrong and folk tales from a variety of cultures. Course work includes generative writing exercises and short, frequent presentations of your work with attention to its aural presentation; one academic paper comparing two pieces we have read for class; and presentation of a final project. Workshops focus on ways to make your work better, clearer, and more understandable through discussion and rewriting..To understand the human, study the monster. To understand the living, study the ghost. This class examines monsters as warnings or omens regarding the future, and ghosts as repetitions of past events. Through various approaches to creative writing, we examine categories of monster, including the living animated from the non-living (the Golem of Prague), creatures that combine parts of recognizable animals (the Minotaur), and differing conceptions of time that ghosts manifest. We draw non-human case studies from Greek mythology, Gothic literature, and contemporary neurological and cybernetic anxieties. Readings may include Ovid?s Metamorphosis, Goblin Market by Christina Rossetti, The Beggarwoman of Locarno by Heinrich von Kleist, Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, The Turn of the Screw and The Jolly Corner by Henry James, A Werewolf Problem in Central Europe by Victor Pelevin, and A Haunted House by Virginia Woolf. Students present their own writing in the form of creative responses to the lectures and the course readings..Writing for time-based work is, obviously, different from other kinds of writing. Whether writing fictional narrative, documentary, personal essay, poetry, or any other form, when situating the work within an imposed time frame means that the text is accompanied by another medium visual, sonic, or performative and that, as it flows past the audience in time, it is inaccessible once passed, save for replay, rewind, or another visit to the work. These constraints necessitate our consideration of the body, of compositional sequence, and, most importantly, of the intentional shaping of time. This class is an opportunity to explore conceptual experiments within these constraints. The students will write in at least 3 modes- towards live performance, towards film/video/plays, and towards sound/radio work. Readings will include selections from these modes and both traditional and experimental, challenging examples of each. The interaction between text written on the page and the life of that text in time colliding with sound and image, enacted in the body is the main focus of this course..Poetry of Self: Confessional Poetry | Marked by the work of Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop (and several others), confessional poetry revolutionized poetic style with its take on subject matter and the relationship between a poems speaker and self. Throughout this class, participants will workshop their own poetry and learn about the work of Sexton and others, as well as contemporary poets such as Sharon Olds, and Terrance Hayes. We will discuss the use of I in contemporary poetry and investigate and analyze the structure, themes and techniques of confessional poetry and the ways in which poetry is still influenced by this movement..The personal essay is a genre where memoir, journalism and philosophy collide. A relatively short piece, it is flexible enough to capture sensations and personal experiences, to observe life, to explore the human condition or to make a point. We will read and discuss essays that do all that and more. Students will write several pieces that range in tone from comic to serious that will be shared in draft form with the group, and polish and revise one piece to formally present near the end of term. We will read venerable older essays as well as contemporary ones, including work by Michel de Montaigne, Sara Suleri, Alain de Botton, James Baldwin, and Lindy West, along with discussing the practical advantages and creative trade-offs of those produced in audio/radio and video..Gen Sem: Creative Nonfiction: Research, Revise, Recycle | How can we use tactics of journalism to refresh our creative nonfiction? In this class, we'll use research methods like archival research and interview for our purposes to excavate the stories we want to write about. We'll also turn editing on its head, thinking about our relationship with revision, not as punishment or failure but as an opportunity to make something even better than our initial imagination offers. Finally, we'll work on recycling old work, taking drafts that never went anywhere and seeing if we can't turn them into something new. Prospective reading list includes: Alexander Chee, Cathy Park Hong, Aminatta Forna, Joseph McPhee, James Baldwin and Teju Cole..In our intensely visual culture, one of the last great advantages written narratives hold over television and film is their ability to represent their characters' inner lives. This course will focus on the representation of consciousness, with an emphasis on texts that transform this project into an organizational principle of their narratives. In other words, consciousness isn't just the 'what' of these texts, but the how of them as well. We will examine a wide-range of works written by both contemporary and not-so-contemporary writers, such as Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, John Edgar Wideman, Mary Gaitskill, Charles Yu, and Zadie Smith. The first half of this course will balance readings with writing exercises. During the later weeks of the semester we will shift into workshops, reading and offering feedback on each other's writing..We will examine the art of poetry. Students will read published poems as models they might follow when drafting their own poems. In a typical semester we will read selections from a wide range of poets. A few stanza forms will be considered: the couplet, quatrain, sonnet, terze rima, free verse, and others. Students will present the work of two published poets, write and share at least two of their own poems or short essays, and constructively critique the poems of their classmates. Readings will vary, sometimes including Dante, Emily Dickinson, Patricia Lockwood, Denis Johnson, Sandra Cisneros, Kevin Young, Ocean Vuong, Esther Balin, Joy Harjo, Langston Hughes, Sylvia Plath, John Ashbery, Philip Larkin, Rita Dove, Seamus Heaney, Paul Muldoon, Shakespeare, Sappho, Susan Wheeler, Sinead Morrissey, Medbh McGuckian, Thomas Lux, Ryka Aoki, Campbell McGrath, and many others, including songwriters. Students will present the work of two published poets, write and share at least two of their own poems or short essays, and constructively critique the poems of their classmates..In this course students will create a singular written project and enrich their understanding of how that project fits into a larger tradition. Through full-class workshops, small-group critiques, individual conferences, and engaged revision, students will deepen the grooves of their writing process and cultivate a practice that is open to feedback and that lets in surprise. Students thesis projects can take multiple forms: poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, comics, drama, hypertext, performance, hybrid work, or a combination thereof. The courses readings and inquiries will be driven both by students own studies into material significant to their writing and by their productive engagement with their classmates work. By the end of the semester, students will have completed a BFAW thesis, consisting of three parts: (1) a creative project; (2) an annotated bibliography; and (3) a reflective essay, which will examine an issue of craft, subject, process, or genre..In this course we will focus on disciplinary and interdisciplinary art and design practices of contemporary art production. This team-taught, year-long class explores the materials and techniques of surface, space, and time (2D, 3D, and 4D), as well as the connections and interplay of these areas. Core Studio integrates the formal with the conceptual, traditional with the contemporary, and makes visible a variety of approaches in current cultural production in order to foster the development of students? emerging practices as makers and thinkers.

In general, Visual and Critical Studies promotes academic and artistic hybridity as a way to examine the social forces that shape our lives. Many fields will be engaged, including queer and feminist theory, literature, social identity, postcolonial studies, art history, and philosophy. The goal is to support student practices by exposing them to various critical conversations related to politics (social life) and art (general creativity). This course prioritizes artists historically marginalized because of their social identities, including gender, race, ethnicity, able-bodiedness, sexual orientation, and more. Some artist, writers, and thinkers to be considered include, Black Audio Film Collective, Glenn Ligon, #decolonizethisplace, Sky Hopinka, Park McArthur, Sunaura Taylor, Michel Foucault, Super Futures Haunt Qollective, and Judith Butler. Screenings will include a variety of videos related to contemporary art and critical theory, including Martha Rosler Reads Vogue: Wishing, Dreaming, Winning, Spending, Forensic Architectures 'Rebel Architecture: The Architecture of Violence,' Coco Fuscos TED Ethology: Primate Visions of the Human Mind, Paper Tiger TVs Donna Haraway Reads the National Geographic on Primates, and Democracy Nows Freed but Not Free: Artists at the Venice Biennale Respond to the #BlackLivesMatter Movement. Coursework includes a reading schedule, research-supported discussions, moments of creative presentation/critique, and writing assignments that engage hybrid approaches to culture, history, and theory..This course is an investigation of how media communicate messages and how we interpret them. From political propaganda to advertisements, television news to ?tweets?, we examine a process of critically 'reading' the many messages that we encounter on a daily basis. Through readings, class discussions, presentations and writing assignments we come to grips with what critic Stuart Ewen has called a world of 'all consuming images.' Readings include works by Plato, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Susan Sontag, Stuart and Elizabeth Ewen, and Henry Jenkins. Assignments include short critical essays on contemporary media, an in-depth at home exam based on class activity and readings, and a term paper or media presentation that analyses a current critical issue in media..These courses draw on the instructor's particular expertise and are pertinent to an understanding of the social influences on and consequences of the production and dissemination of visual images. Topics vary depending on the individual instructor. See topic description for further information..This course is an experimental seminar devoted to recent discussions about disability in the US and in Europe: how is disability represented, and how are these representations constructed? Readings include the following, among many other texts: Georgina Kleege's Sight Unseen, Julia Kristeva's recent essays on disability, and several Supreme Court Opinions regarding ADA, including Alabama v. Garrett, Toyota v. Williams, and Tennessee v. Lane. In the second half of the semester, seminar participants present papers and related research on disability as a social and theoretical construction..This interdisciplinary course approaches the topic of gender, race, and medicine from cultural, historical, and scientific perspectives. We consider hysteria (purported to be caused by a 'wandering uterus') and other mental afflictions associated with sex and gender, the foundation of U.S. gynecology and its dependence on enslaved bodies, the Women's Health Movement and its legacy, queer and trans health issues, and sex health education. Readings include works by Audre Lourde, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Elaine Showalter, Leslie Feinberg and Andrea Smith. We will also consider the ways in which artists have addressed issues of gender, race and medicine in their work. Assignments include an interview project, written reflections, and a final research-based project..This course examines the ways music shapes intersectional identities within broader contexts of migration. What makes music a potent means through which migrants maintain, negotiate, and transform their identities? How does music figure into broader discussions of race, gender, class, and religion in the lives of migrant communities? How is music used to reproduce and contest restrictive immigration policies? We will provide answers to these and other questions in our pursuit of understanding why music matters in the lives of people labelled as 'immigrants,? ?illegal migrants,' and 'refugees.? Readings and screenings will vary but will typically include case studies on traditional and popular music styles affiliated with Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we will draw on theories and methods from ethnomusicology, historical musicology, media studies, gender studies, and critical race studies in our analysis of the linkages between music, migration, and identity. While coursework will vary, students should expect to complete reading responses, exams, fieldwork assignments, and a final project..This course will provide a link between Issues in Visual and Critical Studies, required of all first-year B.A. students, and the Thesis Seminar required in their final year. Typically, students will take this course at the end of their second year of full-time study. Building on the Issues course, early in the course students will read material that suggests the range of possibilities for visual and critical studies. Then each student will undertake a project that focuses on some aspect of visual and critical studies of particular interest to them. The project must include a substantial written component, although it might also make use of other media. Student presentation of their projects, as works in progress and then completed work, will provide opportunity for discussion of how they might give coherence to their final semesters of study. This will include suggestions for connections they might make among different aspects of their education, and will serve as an early stage in the process of developing a senior thesis project..This course offers an introduction to the thought of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995). Deleuze was one of the 20th century?s most influential critical theorists, almost single-handedly revising the reputation of Nietzsche in France, critiquing psychoanalysis in its postmodern heyday, and devising new approaches to ontology, leftist political theory, and literary and art theory. To this day, his concepts are frequently deployed in critical theory of all kinds, especially those concepts he developed in collaboration with activist and psychoanalyst Felix Guattari. Such concepts have even been accused of radical chic, and he remains a frequently cited but ?difficult? author to read. This course provides an introduction to the reading of Deleuze?s work. The goal of the course is to familiarize you with the contours of his career and acquaint you with his peculiar style of writing. It also acquaints you with a (very) few subsequent elaborations on Deleuzian thought. The course is structured into units corresponding to the core notions of becoming, encounter, schizoanalysis, and the rhizome. A fifth unit pursues Deleuze?s involvement with aesthetics and models some ways of applying Deleuzian thought. Expect to read much of Deleuze's own writing, critical reflections on it by Thomas Hirschorn and Elizabeth Grosz, among others..., and then to write two substantial essays elaborating on this material, attempting to make it serve your own interests as artists, historians, etc..This studio seminar is centered around intergenerational queer art-making within the context of The LGBTQ+ Intergenerational Dialogue Project, which is a partnership between The Senior Services Program at The Center on Halsted and faculty members Adam Greteman and Karen Morris of SAIC. This spring course is run as a workshop in which students focus on intergenerational creative production with LGBTQ+ elders. Classes will be held at both SAIC and Center on Halsted. Students and elders will share a meal together after class meetings at Center on Halsted, and take at least one field trip together. A range of artists, works, scholars, and activist groups will be introduced during the first third of the course as students get to know one another and the purpose of the course. This will potentially include the following: Marlon Riggs, Lesbian Avengers, Chase Joynt, ACT-UP, Ron Athey, S.T.A.R., Paul Preciado, E. Patrick Johnson, Mickalene Thomas, and others. Over the course of the latter 2/3rd of the semester, students collaborate with LGBTQ+ elders in small groups to conceive and produce work related to LGBTQ+ experiences, histories, and issues. Each small group decides on topic(s) and medium(s) while working with the instructors to create a list of relevant readings, films, and/or podcasts they will engage as part of the research and production process. Over the course of the semester, students collaborate with LGBTQ+ elders in small groups to conceive and produce work related to LGBTQ+ experiences, histories, and issues. Final projects might take the form of visual art, video, oral history, photography, writing, a podcast, or something else. This work will be showcased on the projects website (generationliberation.com) and have the potential to be expanded into a range of other educational resources..This course is a continuation of Undergraduate Thesis: Research and Writing I. Students will continue to work on the drafts developed during the first semester and will meet at times as a group and at times individually with the instructor or teaching assistant. By the end of the semester, each student will have a 25-35 page superbly written thesis (maximum 45 pages), which will most likely (although it is not required) have visual content. Students will also present their thesis projects in the VCS Undergraduate Thesis Symposium at the end of the semester. Class meetings are used to discuss readings, workshop writing, share research methods and techniques, and discuss research and writing problems. Guest speakers and group visits to libraries may also be part of the class.

This seminar is required for the Master of Arts in Modern Art History, Theory, and Criticism and is taken in the second or third semester of course work..In this course, we will explore the ways in which the idea of persistence might be said to characterize modern and contemporary Native American and Indigenous arts practices--including performance, film, video, painting, sculpture, printmaking, and photography, among others. The artists we will examine employ a range of tactics to engage social, cultural, economic, and political relationships as they occupy and articulate Indigenous worldviews and systems of knowledge that are often incommensurable with Settler structures and ideologies..This survey class of Modern and Contemporary Indian art from the 20th century to date examines the rich and complex art practices which emerged from pre-independent India to its transition as an independent nation in 1947. We will discuss the works of the most significant Indian artists and unpack the concepts of tradition/ modern, nationalism/internationalism and, globalization, to investigate the same through the writings of eminent postcolonial scholars such as Geeta Kapur, Homi Bhabha, Partha Mitter, Gayatri Spivak, and Saloni Mathur to name a few. The course gives a critical insight into India as a nation, the challenges it faces including the socio-political climate that is reflected in the artist's work and practices that make Indian art distinct. The class examines Indian art from the early 20th century including the works of Raja Ravi Varma and Amrita Sher-Gil to the currently contemporary emerging avant-garde art practices today. This includes the work of the Progressive Artist Group; such as Maqbool Fida Husain, Syed Haider Raza, and Francis Newton Souza amongst others, to other prominent artists such as K. G. Subramanyan and Bhupen Khakhar. We will examine the first wave of the feminist artist's as Nalini Malani, Nilima Sheikh, Arpita Singh, and Madhvi Parikh, moving to the more contemporary art practices such as Subodh Gupta, Anita Dube, Bharti Kher, Jitish Kallat, Nikhil Chopra, Mithu Sen, and Shilpa Gupta to name a few. The course work will include weekly readings a mid- term paper and a final paper. Class participation and discussion is encouraged..The field of curating grew exponentially in the last three decades: from the discourse produced about curatorial practices, through the visibility and status that is (sometimes) awarded to the position of the curator, to the impact that curatorial projects have had on culture and society at large. This course unpacks all these facets of curating, examining it as a unique combination of a research-and-creative practice that is always directed at the public. Together we will analyze (1) 'curatorial thinking,' i.e. understanding the research methods that curators use as well as (2) 'curatorial doing,' i.e. the variety of formats used to communicate this research to the public. Students will learn about the differences between the curator and the artist as well as the curator and the academic. They will consider not only exhibitions of art, but a whole array of curatorial practices engaging with the larger cultural field. They will gain an understanding of the current state of curatorial discourse, key terms, and challenges as well as gain familiarity with major practitioners. Students will read texts, participate in discussion, and team exercises. They will develop a curatorial idea around a culturally relevant issue of their choosing..Incorporating daily visits to the Art Institute of Chicago, this undergraduate and graduate seminar will examine the history of European and American art from the 1870s to the twentieth century through the focused engagement with objects in the museum collections. Class time will be divided between classroom lectures, discussions of daily reading assignments, and museum visits. In all of these, students will be expected to take an active participatory role. Course topics will be determined in relation to the collections on view, but recurring questions will focus on materiality and display..This course surveys developments in nineteenth and twentieth century art and architecture. Particular emphasis is placed on theoretical and critical issues, as well as the historical, intellectual, and socioeconomic changes that are reflected or addressed in the works of artists and architects. Note: ARTHI 1001 (or its equivalent) is recommended as a prerequisite for ARTHI 1002..Since the early 1960s, artists have increasingly experimented with alternative methods of disseminating their ideas, using books or records, occasionally collaborating in periodicals, and other uncategorized projects. Students investigate the increasing acceptability of such activities and discuss a broad variety of publishing, from guerrilla fly-posting through mail-art magazines to the exhibition-in-a-book, including the unconventional artists' bookwork. Examining both well-known examples and obscure occurrences, the course attempts to place alternative art publishing in a contemporary context..The horror film and the American city have much in common. Both are fraught with anxieties, stained with fluids and flesh. They share a soundtrack of screams. When set in urban environments, horror films manifest complicated representations of race and class, often intersecting in surprising ways with gender and sexuality, the horror genre's most well-trodden subjects. Focusing on the last four decades, when the urban thriller's evolution has mirrored one of the most turbulent and transformative periods in our cities, this class places these films in historical and theoretical contexts as a means to tackle these urgent issues. Films include, but are not limited to: Rosemary's Baby, Polanski; Blacula, Crain; Death Wish, Winner; Looking for Mr. Goodbar, Brooks; Cruising, Friedkin; Ms. 45, Ferrara; Child's Play, Holland; People Under the Stairs, Craven; Candyman, Rose; Summer of Sam, Lee; In The Cut, Campion..Art has been many things to many people.

Students will learn to perform basic art historical analysis and research, and the course will prepare them to form personal art histories, applying such art histories to their own work. The course surveys historical art in a global scope, from the beginnings of known culture to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. It introduces students to a range of interdisciplinary frameworks for parsing the production, reception, and conceptualization of art. And it challenges students to think about the relationships between past and present, highlighting how later artists and cultures have engaged earlier art and history. There is a small amount of required reading each week-on average about 20 pages. Written work includes weekly reading responses, two in-class quizzes, an annotated bibliography project, and a take-home final exam..This course covers the history of animated film, from its pre-cinematic beginnings to the beginning of the television era (ca. 1960). It traces the development of the Hollywood studio cartoon, along with parallel developments in European and Japanese animation and experimental and abstract works.

SAIC,Performance,"This course introduces students to digital pattern-making for fashion. Students learn to use the CAD hardware and software, designing and modifying patterns virtually. This includes digitizing/converting hard patterns to digital files, modifying existing stock patterns, textile printing, 3-D visualization, and plotting sample patterns. Students receive a hands-on approach to developing virtual patterns through fabric testing, using body measurements, and assembling prototypes for final design approval. Other industry skills are developed, such as creating pattern cards, cutter's musts, grading, and marker making..This course develops drawing skills with an emphasis on figure gesture and proportion along with a wide range of media. Students are taught to sketch from a live model while communicating design concepts in clothing with style and expression..This course explores the sensualness and design of over one hundred years of lingerie making through the use of beautiful fabrics including linen, lace, silk, satin, chiffon and ribbons. Historical references and modern technology are explored through slides, video, books, museums and boutiques for the design of lingerie and under garments. The students drape, make patterns, and fit on a live model. Students are required to make one garment in muslin and their choice of fabric..This course explores the flexibility of cut & sew knitwear. From the comfort of the ubiquitous T-shirt to high performance athletic wear, fashion made with pliant knitted fabrics is everywhere. In its brief history since the invention of the button-less shirt in jersey fabric, sewn knitwear has ushered in radically modern dress through sportswear, dancewear, and athletic wear. Designers, stylistic innovation and technological processes are further examined through lectures and case studies. Students will explore the variations and design potential of flexible knitted fabrics, and the considerations, methods, and equipment to assemble and finish designs cut from knit fabric. Designers, stylistic innovation and technological processes are further examined through lectures and case studies. These include fashion designers Stephen Burrows, Rudi Gernreich, Xuly Bet, Coco Chanel, or Donna Karans 5 easy pieces, as well as in iconographic performances such as by Nicolais Louis Dance, or Martha Grahams Lament, or contemporary artists such as Erneste Neto or Malin Bulow. Students will explore the variations and design potential of flexible knitted fabrics, and the considerations, methods, and equipment to assemble and finish designs cut from knit fabric. They will drape, make patterns and block, and stitch finished garments from their design and research; first in a test fabric with similar properties, and then in a material, color and detail (optional) of their choice..Beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels are given technical guidance in the use of dyes and pigments on fabrics. Both hand-painting and -printing processes are explored. The technical vocabulary may include: silkscreen, photographic techniques, stencil and stamp printing, and direct painting.

This will be inspiring and give keen insight to sustainable and regenerative efforts being made on multiple levels. This course has no prerequisites..This class is inspired by Johannes Itten?s radical early twentieth-century basic art course developed for the Weimar Bauhaus School of Art, but here using the Maya 3D software, typically used for commercial productions by the entertainment industry. Students will solve a series of formal problems, introduced in increasing levels of complexity. Moving from the 2-dimensional to the 3-dimensional and ultimately to the four-dimensional or time-based, students will evolve their abilities to utilize aspects of light and dark, form, rhythm, color, proportion and volume but in terms of a post photographic discourse, with the intention of advancing a new virtual cinema..This class introduces the traditional animation techniques of creating movement through successive drawings. Techniques include metamorphosis, walking cycles, holds, squash and stretch, blur and resistance. Students use the pencil test Lunch-Box to view their work . Students complete a series of exercises encouraging a full range of animation skills and a final project. Films illustrating drawn-animation techniques are screened regularly..This course is an introduction to the concepts and processes utilized in the production of digital and analogue to digital 2-D animation. Students work especially with Photoshop and After Effects to develop projects. Complex compositing and layering are also explored in this class. Screenings vary but include primarily contemporary filmmakers / animators using tools covered in class, ranging from student films from other countries and institutions to professional and more commercial examples - all of which will be critiqued and discussed heavily each week. The first 7-8 weeks of class are spent creating ultra short animated films, along with a longer final project at the end of the semester..Intermediate Screenwriting expands upon the skills learned in Beginning Screenwriting while preparing certain students for the longer-form writing required in Advanced Screenwriting. The purpose of the course is to allow students to develop mid-length stand-alone screenplays, adaptations from short stories or pilots for television series, while paying special attention to the vital role that drafting plays in the development of a successful script. Since Intermediate Screenwriting is first and foremost a writing class, there will be no formal reading or viewing assignments. However, throughout the semester, the professor will suggest books and articles to read and films to watch, that should help further and develop the various ideas that students are wrestling with in their scripts. For example, a work such as Kieslowski's ''The Decalogue'' will be suggested for students looking to embrace a thematic approach to a series of short films. Students have the option of completing two drafts of a 60-page script or three drafts of a 30-45 page script. Completion of these drafts are required to pass the class",2
SAIC,Photography,"The short story cycle is a unique art form a collection of stories that presents different interpretive possibilities. The stories are meant to be interpreted individually, but the work is also meant to function as a whole. From its inception, the short story cycle was a radical approach to literary form. Modernist questions of the reliability of narrative perspective, post-modern interrogations of truth and construct are all baked into the short-story cycles form. The short story democratizes literary perspective, by definition, and its content often follows its formal possibilities. Short story cycles often tell stories we hadnt heard before, through voices we hadnt heard before. Weekly reading responses, two short papers, one Final paper, and a Final Presentation..This course deals with some of the deepest philosophical issues concerning human beings and non-human animals: (1) Is human life special in some way? Does it have meaning? (2) Is it true, as most people believe, that procreation (having children) is not only morally permissible, but a good thing? Or is the position of anti-natalismthat procreation is wrong or harmfulthe more convincing position? (3) Is death bad for human beings or is it a neutral event? If death is bad for human beings, why is it bad? (4) Is abortion morally wrong or morally permissible? (5) Is suicide morally wrong or morally permissible? And when is it either? (6) Is it morally permissible for human beings to kill non-human animals so as to use them for food and other resources? (7) Is death bad for non-human animals in the same way as it is bad for human beings? Or is it not bad for them at all? These are the basic question that this course addresses. Some of the authors we read include David Benatar, Christine Overall, Don Marquis, Thomas Nagel, Alastair Norcross, Seana Shiffrin, Richard Taylor, Judith Jarvis Thomson, and David Wasserman. Assignments vary, but they might include some or many of the following: weekly reading responses, quizzes, papers, and exams..Fungi are members of a kingdom of organisms that is distinct from plants and animals. They are exceptionally enigmatic, not just to everyday people, but to scientists as well. This course serves as a primer to the world of fungi, defining what fungi are and what they are not, and providing a conceptual understanding of these organisms. We explore the taxonomic diversity of fungi before considering their diversity from an ecological perspective. Students learn to identify different forms of fungi, grow them in the lab, and perform experiments to understand how they function. Finally, this course evaluates the importance of fungi from a practical human standpoint (food, medicine, art, spirituality), and discuss important questions to be addressed in the scientific field of mycology..Why do birds migrate? When do whales sing? What does a bee's dance mean? Animals have fascinating behaviors that have both puzzled and amazed observers. This class will explore current theories behind these actions. The lecture/discussion aspects of this course will focus on theories and concepts while the lab component will focus on collecting (Virtual zoo camera) observational data on local fauna and coming up with hypothesis to explain the observed behaviors. Student-collected original data will then be discussed and new or additional theories proposed. This course includes VIRTUAL Zoo camera data observations from any zoo around the world that has zoo cameras!.Gender theory is mobilized in feminist activism toward a variety of goals. This course will offer a survey of social theories of gender and will proceed to identify them as the foundations and justifications of social movements in each wave of feminism. Theories include de Beauvoir, Crenshaw, Rubin, Schilt, and Butler. Social movements will include suffragettes, NOW, the Combahee River Collective, riot grrrl, Sisters in Islam, and transgender social movements..Since the early twentieth century, radio technology has shaped innovations in communication, news, and entertainment. This powerful medium has driven political influences, established cultural trends, generated communal listenership, and diminished spatial boundaries for the dissemination of information. Radio served as a precursor for later forms of mass media such as television, the Internet, and podcasts. This course will address the history, theory, and aesthetics of radio transmission in Europe and North America. Through lectures, discussion, listening, reading, and writing, students will explore radio?s influence on social habits, political dynamics, and artistic expression..How have Latinx authors addressed the representation of Latinidad in literature and other cultural forms? How does the study of these representations change or revitalize our understanding of literature more broadly? These classes offer students with the opportunity to undertake a detailed study of thematic material related to Latinx literature, including its connections to Latinx culture more broadly. Depending on the instructor, the period and works may vary. Artists/Works/Screening/Reading/Content Area examples to be determined, based on the specific course being offered under this topic, but will include key texts and other cultural forms (i.e.films, television, and comics) by Latinx authors and artists. This 3000-level Humanities course, including readings, reading responses, essays, mid-terms, and finals..This course surveys over 2,000 years of music in Western civilization. Historical, cultural, and social contexts are studied as they pertain to the music. After an introduction to the Greeks (8th century BCE), music such as medieval chants, motets, Renaissance masses, madrigals, Baroque concertos, operas, and Classical symphonies (ca. up to 1800) are studied. Lectures trace the changes from vocal to instrumental practices with closer looks at some representative period instruments. Biographies are used to demonstrate social, educational and geo-political changes, which shaped the final results of composers' creativity: music. European musical centers -- Paris, Venice, and Vienna -- and their musical establishments receive special attention. Students learn a macro-level music vocabulary and are encouraged to use it in their discourse. Each lecture is structured around a composition that exemplifies the most salient features of a particular period. Listening and reading is required before each lecture. Students are assigned two short essays (6 pages each) as well as a midterm and a final exam that focus on listening skills and understanding/usage of music vocabulary..Scientists now know that global warming is causing more hurricanes? or is it? This course will explore how environmental disasters ? both man-made and natural ? impact human society and the biosphere, and how they have changed in both frequency and intensity in response to climate change. Some relevant topics that this class will investigate include: heat waves and cold snaps, links between climate change and vectorborne diseases, tropical cyclones, tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, environmental impacts of natural gas fracking and oil spills, El Ni?o, long and short-term species extinction, ecosystem responses to climate change, and more. We will consider current news articles and relevant policy solutions/responses, and class work will involve group work, critical thinking, quantitative practice and analysis of scientific literature. Course work will include quantitative in-class assignments, relevant scientific readings, qualitative homework, quizzes, an exam and a final project..This course welcomes students interested in the field broadly called queer theory--even if they dont have a background in womens, gender, or sexuality studies. It requires neither expertise nor past experience precisely because the primary question the class experiments with is: What could queer theory look like if we begin from the premise that its model subject is not white? The syllabus is organized around how queer theory is differently distributed and taken up by various fields of inquiry/analysis, methodological approaches, and traditions of activism and cultural production. Well use many genres and forms of queer of color theorizing as points of entry into concepts central to queer/critical thought (like intimacy, power, subjectivity, labor, sex). Well read legal scholars (like Kenji Yoshino, Kimberl Crenshaw, Ian Lpez) alongside theorists of performance/performativity (like E. Patrick Johnson, Jos Muoz); well put historical manifestos (like those by Radicalesbians, the Combahee River Collective) in conversation with contemporary literary manifestos (like Joshua Chambers-Letsons); well treat graphic novels (like Jaime Cortezs Sexile) as works of philosophy and works of political philosophizing (like writing by Cathy Cohen, C. Riley Snorton, Jeff Nunokawa) as poetic/aesthetic; well watch web series (like Brown Girls) and well write a lot. Well use short, though frequent, critical reflections to frame class discussions and youll use longer paper and/or creative projects to consolidate/present your learning..These classes cover a variety of topical and geographically oriented courses in Sociology. These include courses on race, ethnicity, gender, and class from a sociological perspective..In this course we explore how some of the best poets through the centuries have invented, mastered, stretched, challenged, rejected, and reinvented poetic forms. We investigate origins of the haiku, ghazal, sonnet, villanelle, pantoum, blues poem, sestina, ballad, prose poem, concrete poem, and a few other original forms, and we question how modern and contemporary examples both honor and deny the traditions these forms have aroused. Our intentions for this course are not merely to revere formal structures and marvel at how poets have succeeded in meeting verse requirements. More significantly, our aim is to tease open the workings of really good poems to see if we might understand how they mean and perhaps even why they affect us. 'Form is nothing more than a transubstantiation of content,' the poet Charles Wright tells us. If this is true, and if poetic form still holds some of the sweat of its makers, then in looking hard at form we have a chance of uncovering what has mattered-and perhaps still matters-most in human experience..This course examines the unique role that music has played in the cultural development of the United States, taking a critical look at the historical and geographical context for the development of American musical styles, including the role of slavery. We will critically engage the role that 19th Century blackface and minstrelsy played in providing the framework for both the foundations of the popular culture industry, and the conditions that resulted in the construction of cultural 'blackness.' We will examine the various regional styles of music that have developed in the United States, including the blues, ragtime, spirituals, country, jazz, bluegrass, and folk music, noting the manner in which style and gesture is traded back and forth. We will identify the musical characteristics of the primary styles of early American music, what distinguishes each, and trace their evolution to the music we listen to today. By spotting the way a note is bent or how the backbeat is played, we will map the route from the churches of the early frontier to the songs of Kendrick Lamar. Assignments may include weekly readings, approximately 3 short papers, one term paper, a final exam, and an in-class presentation, presented either alone or in a small group..A monolith manifests in orbit around Jupiter, emitting a signal. A beacon? A winter-bound planets denizens are androgynous with powerful predictive powers. An aberration? Space travel is enabled by the ingestion of enormous quantities of a geriatric spice a messianic figure suddenly learns to manipulate. A drug trip?! Among popular genres, science fiction is the riskiest conceptually and among the trickiest to master. Because of its relative narrative freedom, science fiction has been a place for some of the wildest, most outlandish, yet frequently astute speculation on the experience of religion that can be found in all modern literature. In this course, youll read some novels (by William Gibson, Frank Herbert, and Ursula K. LeGuin), short stories, (by Ted Chiang, Arthur C. Clarke, and Raccoona Sheldon), and view some films (2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, and Close Encounters), and study the work of some theorists of religion (Freud, Jung, Levi-Strauss, and Eliade). Assignments vary, but they might include some or many of the following: weekly reading responses, quizzes, papers, and exams..In this course students learn about the scientific roots and complexities of diagnosing the most pressing environmental crises of the twenty-first century, their ethical and legal impacts on society, and the potential to achieve sustainability for the future. We raise stimulating ethical and legal debates about topics such as depletion of oceanic resources, loss of biodiversity, habitat destruction, depletion of topsoil, degradation of groundwater and more. This class is about critical thinking and incorporates team projects, debate, class discussion, and independent research to investigate the current state of the global condition and potential for a sustainable future..Globalizations inequalities mark global cities. This course investigates 'inequality' and 'global cities' as mutually intertwined constructs and empirical phenomena, constructs/phenomena that are important not only to academics, but also to policymakers, activists, and the myriad groups that get erased through constantly shifting imperatives to become global. We will approach both 'inequality' and 'global city' as multiple, contested terrains, examining how they have shifted over time in response to changing economic, geopolitical, migrational, cultural, racial, gendered, and other conditions. The course begins with an introduction to classic theorizations of global cities and urban inequality through scholarship that is self-consciously global in its orientation. We then expand our focus both historically and methodologically exploring histories of the 'global city' as both a site and policy imperativetogether with a deep dive into ethnographies of Southeast Asian and U.S. cities (especially Chicago). This course begins with classic theorizations of global cities and urban inequality. Later sections will focus on ethnographies of cities in the Americas, Europe, Gulf Coast, and Asia. Rather than treating these as distinct geographic or historical 'units,' each section of the course will explore broad continuities across locales while simultaneously exploring the particularities of each site. Key authors include Ta-Nehisi Coates, Marco Garrido, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, David Harvey, Laavanya Kathiravelu, Marcia McKenzie, Aihwa Ong, Jason Orne, Saskia Sassen, Eve Tuck, etc. Course work will include reading responses; a presentation; two in-class, group-based text-collage assignments; and a final project..There are fantastic books by Asian American writers but often they are not taught in school, or part of pop culture, or included in the literary canon. Who decides which writers and books are worthy of reading? In this discussion based course, we will critically read, think, and write about texts by contemporary Asian American authors. We will analyze multiple factors that have influenced the creation of the texts and that are explored within them, such as race, diaspora, memory, family, politics, community, and identifying oneself and ones artwork. The readings will be across genre: novels, poetry, non-fiction, and graphic novels. Readings often include works by Victoria Chang, Mira Jacob, Alexander Chee, Jenny Xie, Ocean Vuong, Ted Chiang, and Cathy Park Hong among others. We will freewrite, formulate conceptual questions for the readings, write responses, and compose 2 essays based on individual inquiry and analysis..Mastering a body of literature in the context of its specific historical, sociological, and ideological period is emphasized. The period and works vary..In this course, we will introduce core sociological themes such as racialization, gender, social class, power, culture, and capitalism. As we cover these topics, we will explore research on Chicago, primarily but also from the US at large and other global contexts. We will pay particular attention to relations between these social processes and their environments, considering both urban and rural settings and the natural and built environment. We will ask questions such as: What is society? How do patterns of social structure and reproduction shape inequality? Can these structures be transformed? What is the role of social knowledge and research in political activism? What methods might we employ when trying to understand social life? What are the advantages and disadvantages of ethnographic, historical, quantitative, visual, geographic, and other methodologies? Contemporary authors may include: Pattillo on segregation in Chicago, Miller on life in Chicago after mass incarceration, Flores on immigration and legality, Bonilla-Silva on structural racism, England on gender stratification, Lareau on childhood and life course, Khan on privilege and education, Desmond on precarious housing, and Tufekci on technology and social movements. Foundational texts may include texts by Du Bois, Jane Addams, Fanon, Radhakamal Mukerjee, C. Wright Mills, the Chicago School of Sociology, Marx, and Weber. We will also screen documentaries and visual work from groups such as the Chicago-based Kartemquin Films group. Coursework will include weekly reading responses, some group work, a presentation, and a final paper..This class offers small group tutoring for students who do not speak English as their first language. Students meet with an EIS instructor in groups of three for 1 1/2 hours each week. Students receive assistance with their class assignments for Art History, Liberal Arts and Studio classes.

We will spend this semester reading and writing texts structured around the movement of the self in the city and country, at home and away, considering both content and representations of the body in space. We will look at authors, filmmakers and conceptual artists from a range of linguistic and cultural backgrounds to ask: What kind of literary devices does the author use? How does the tone/style contribute to the work as a whole? How does the text build, sentence by sentence or scene by scene? Are specific images repeated and/or used differently throughout the work? Students should expect to write 15-20 pages of formal, revisable writing..This is the first of two English language fluency courses for students who do not speak English as their first language.

Students will expand their conceptual and technical artmaking repertoire as well as develop college-level writing skills, using studio visits as inspiration for fine art and writing assignments alike. Our group ventures will acclimate students to our windy city and offer an insider perspective into the creative vibrancy of Chicago as we head to various neighborhoods beyond our downtown campus. From source material and research to query and concept to process and technique, each and every artist makes and thinks about their work differently. Our studio visits will afford students the opportunity to experiment and innovate for themselves based on their experiences in each artists space. Writing assignments will be based primarily around artistic practice and analysis of artworks. We will read short writings by Langston Hughes, Twyla Tharp, Scott McCloud, Bernard Cooper, Margaret Atwood, G.K. Chesterton, Maya Lin, and Vincent van Gogh, among others. In addition to short writing assignments and in-class journals, students should expect to write and revise 3 main essays totaling 15-20 of formal prose. In-class studio/making time will be punctuated by one-on-one meetings and informal interim critiques. The course will culminate in a final critique of the series of works students produced over the course of the summer..In this filmmaking, animation, installation, and writing studio-symposium, we will investigate a city in motion through the moving image, the written word, and firsthand exploration. Students will expand their conceptual and technical filmmaking repertoire as well as develop college-level writing skills, using Chicago itself as inspiration for a range of media-driven projects and writing assignments. Activities will include field trips to local Chicago studios and art installations to help inspire our work. This is also a studio writing class in which we will focus on writing as a process. We will freewrite, learn to close read images and texts, formulate lines of inquiry and conceptual questions that drive our claims and arguments, and develop ideas that matter. Students can expect to compose and revise 15-20 pages in multidraft formal writing assignments in addition to homework and in-class writing..Generative art, resulting from creative practices involving automation and artificial intelligence, has existed for decades if not centuries. Already in 1970, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago created a department called Generative Systems to study and experiment with art practices harnessing new technologies. Still, with the recent release of powerful text-to-image generators and natural language processors, many are celebrating, dreading, and warning of a brave new world where machines can automatically create art which once would have required countless hours of human labor, experience, and courage. Were Witnessing the Birth of a New Artistic Medium, reported The Atlantic in September 2022. In November, The Guardian asked, When AI can make art what does it mean for creativity? Artists were understandably outraged when an AI-generated artwork, Thtre D'opra Spatial won first place for digital art in the Colorado State Fairs fine arts competition. Together well experiment at the intersection of technology and art, exploring what it means to make art when algorithms can automate parts of the creative process. Whether you believe that auto-generative AI democratizes or dehumanizes artistic creation, rather than dismiss or fight an inevitable future of auto-generative artificial intelligence in art, well discover how emergent technologies can enhance human creativity and promote humane artistic practices. FYS II develops college-level writing skills, preparing students for upper-level Liberal Arts courses. Students will create original research (and textual art) around topics including authenticity, mimesis, copyright, autonomy, automation, (non)human creativity, and the evolving markets for artistic work. Well develop and refine the writing skills learned in FYS I while experimenting with generative writing and research methods. Students will leave this course with a portfolio of original, publishable writing, as well as a foundational grasp of the history and futures of generative art. Readings and screenings may vary but will focus on pioneers in the creation, curation, and market of generative art. Some of the scholars and artists we will engage with in this course include Sonia Landy Sheridan, Georg Nees, Frieder Nake, Vera Molnr, Margaret Boden, and Francesca Franco. Students will create 20-25 pages of formal, revisable, and publishable writing across three short essays and two in-depth revisions. Students will also learn to write a research paper, using scholarly constraints to enhance creativity...Liberalism is a political philosophy and tradition whose principles have guided western political practice for hundreds of years. Liberalism has given rise to the liberal subject, a human individual with a natural right to life, to liberty (political freedom, freedom of speech, press and religion) and to property. Certainly, under law but also within this cultural framework, many classes of human beings (enslaved people, indigenous people, people with disabilities or people experiencing houselessness, for example) have not been protected in this way, nor have been animals and plants. These prejudices are often entangled. In recent decades, within the context of ecological degradation, environmental racism and climate collapse, the rights of other-than-human beings have presented themselves as a critical cultural and political shifts to undertake. In this course we will interrogate the history of the rights of nature, and work to observe and even model an expanded political subject that is not just human, but human-in-relation to other-than-human beings. IF we are, in fact, entangled beings, and the individual subject is a kind of fiction, could we cast a wider net and protect this entangled being that is both us and Other? This course is a one-time offering held adjacent to an artistic project created by Associate Professor Sara Black, artist Amber Ginsburg (University of Chicago) and political theorist Sam Frost (UIUC) for the Gray Center for Arts and Inquiry (https://graycenter.uchicago.edu/fellowships/untidy-objects). The course will be held off-campus at The Gray Center (Logan Center for the Arts - 915 E 60th St, Chicago, IL) and within a living sculpture produced by Sam, Amber and Sara in the field adjacent to the Center. Students may learn more about The Gray Center for Arts and Inquiry and the Untidy Objects project by following this link: https://graycenter.uchicago.edu/fellowships/untidy-objects We will ground our work in seminar style readings and discussion with texts that explore the history of the liberal subject, the movement toward the rights of nature, indigenous philosophies, and how the visual arts have engaged in these histories. We will read from Suzaane Simard, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Winona LaDuke, Laurence Tribe, Peter Burdon, Donna Haraway and more. We will explore the expanded field in sculpture and relational art as parallel to contemporary political theory, eco-criticism, and environmental justice. Students will engage in daily field observations of plant and animal communities, horticultural design, creative writing exercises, discussions, reflective summaries and produce onesculptural and/or relational form in collaboration or individually..This course examines forms of critique and post critique. It will interpret artwork within contemporary and historical political and philosophical arguments. It will also address and evaluate specific modes of interpretation and critique, including forms shaped by institutional, intellectual, and in some cases vernacular histories.

SAIC,Printmedia,"This 3-week summer intensive looks forward by looking backward, researching, enacting, and embodying practices that for one reason or another have been disregarded in the wake of progress, and relegated to the archives of history. Students will participate in the event with individual and collaborative projects involving writing, installation, documentation, and live performance. Teachers and visiting scholars will lecture on related subjects. Available for credit and non-credit enrollment. Abandoned practices constitutes an emerging field of inquiry pioneered by Alan Read of King?s College, London, author of Theatre, Intimacy, and Engagement: The Last Human Venue (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008). The course focus will allow a thematic meeting place that confronts the common accelerated temporalities of the 21st century, whether in the form of economic and artistic globalization, technologies ceaseless upgrade, or the general shifts in understanding the word local. The course does not propose that we share a mutual past, but rather that we might mutually discover a shared strategy of thinking about our pasts, a strategy of reimagining and reenacting the different abandoned practices that once defined the ordinary..This basic class, required for entry into all other photo classes, introduces contemporary technologies for producing photographic images. This course also introduces seeing, thinking and creating with a critical mind and eye to provide greater understanding of the construction and manipulation of photographic form and meaning. Approaching the medium in its current complex and pluralistic state, students explore a variety of photographic concepts and techniques. While various physical cameras are still in use today the fundamentals of using digital cameras, including manual exposure and lighting are stressed. Eclectic forms of output are explored in order to discover methods of presentation most suited to a particular idea. 'Knowledge of photography is just as important as that of the alphabet. The illiterate of the future will be a person ignorant of the use of the camera as well as the pen.' Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946). This course will address the complex and continual shifting nature of photography; what influences our understanding of how a photograph functions while exploring a diverse array of photographic genres and applications. Assignments will provide technical skills to use cameras, compose images and print digital photographs. Readings, screenings and discussions will provide a framework for critically analyzing the photographs we encounter every day, as well as our own photographs..In the conventions of still life painting, arrangements of everyday materials reflect on larger themes of temporality, death, the body, consumption, and commodity. The Still Life Image is a studio course taking an expansive view of the still life genre: seeking to explore its generative potential for contemporary photographic practice, while unpacking its relevance to dialogues around materiality, objecthood, and images in the digital age. This topics course is structured around core readings, the viewing and discussion of artworks, and the production of personal work. Course materials explore how traditional attitudes of the still life genre are being reimagined in contemporary practice, while providing frameworks from art history and contemporary theory. Each student will create a focused body of work over the course of this three-week summer intensive. Course structure and syllabus will be adjusted to the circumstances unfolding at the time of the class. This course is a space for innovation and creative approaches to both learning and making, in ways that are active and responsive to changing conditions..Students are introduced to using light as a means for creative control. By studying the light around us, we are able to better serve our work through specific choices with regard to existing or ambient light and light augmented by other sources of illumination.

Returning students will expand upon previous projects and develop new approaches to exploring content and understanding relief techniques. Students will be exposed to a wide variety of artists from the long and rich history of relief printmaking. We will examine artists who work traditionally within the medium, as well as artists who depend upon contemporary technology to create prints. Some of the artists we will explore in this course include Durer, Hokusai, Masereel, Mendez, Zarina and Baumgartner. Over the course of the semester, students will create 10-20 prints that show an understanding of the various relief techniques demonstrated by the instructor. Students will also participate in a print exchange folio at the end of the course. Projects will be critiqued throughout the semester..Artists Books is a beginning/intermediate level course that focuses on the fundamental techniques of bookbinding so as to be able to design and produce one or an edition of artists books and boxes. The class begins by learning a range of traditional binding techniques, discussing material choices, and learning about the history of artists books. Later on breaking out of the box to take risks, explore concepts and unconventional materials will be strongly encouraged for individual projects. In addition, the intention of this class is to meld your own studio work and personal expression with the form of artists books..This class introduces students to the concepts and production of distributable artists projects. Working closely with faculty, students develop projects to be printed on the Heidelberg offset press and Risograph machines.

Students will engage in daily field observations of plant and animal communities, horticultural design, creative writing exercises, discussions, reflective summaries and produce onesculptural and/or relational form in collaboration or individually..Materials Lab: Raw & Cooked Materials will explore five techniques of material reuse and invention: densify, reconfigure, transform, design and cultivate. Dispensing with the notion of nature as raw material, standing supply, this course begins with surplus, waste and by-products as an earlier beginning point of meaning and making. This class will look at vernacular architecture, secondary use design and current industrial models of material manufacture to understand both the physical properties of materials and their interconnected social, political and ethical meaning..This course offers instruction in various methods of casting, including simple plaster molds, hydrocal-cement casts, simple body casts, thermal-setting rubber molds, wax, terra cotta, and paper casting. Students are advised to bring objects they desire to cast. (No hot metal casting in this course.).This course introduces students to the basics of sculpture fabrication and production. Students of this course will become authorized to use the department's facilities through a series of material projects and assignments that enable safe and competent work in three areas: Moldmaking, Metal Fabrication and Woodworking. The class will design and make molds suitable for casting models from simple and complex patterns in the mold-making studio. The class will use cutting, bending, rolling, welding and finishing techniques in the Metal Fabrication Studio to produce a project in steel. In the Woodshop, the class will learn to design a project in wood using the following machine tools: table saw, dado blades, jointer, planer, band saw, router, pneumatic brad nailer, and sanders. Upon completing Sculpture Bootcamp, students will have the authorizations and experience they need to take full advantage of the sculpture department open shop facilities..This research, discussion, and critique course develops a visual and verbal vocabulary by examining relationships between form and content, word and image. Study includes symbolic association and the problem of effective communication in a highly complex culture..Digital visualization is essential to all contemporary creative communication. This class will familiarize students with the syntax, tools and methods of vector-based drawing and reinforce analogies to traditional methods of image-making covered in the First Year Program. Students will begin with an introduction to the computer as a graphic design tool: the relationship of vector to raster graphics and the peripherals. The focus on building proficiency with industry-standard Adobe Illustrator software will be reinforced via tutorials and short design exercises which target specific topics and techniques covered during lectures. Students apply technical competencies to formal design problems during the second half of this course and in Beginning Graphic Design class..This studio course explores typography's impact on language to create meaning, organization and tone. Students experiment in typographic composition and page structure with special regard to the flow and rupture of different text types and reading scenarios. Students learn the technical aspects of typography (specification and copyfitting), methods for composing dynamic multipage formats (combining digital and analog), and contexts (both historical and structural) for understanding the vast repository of typefaces. This course is a core requirement for the Visual Communication Design portfolio review. The framing text for this class is Ellen Lupton's Thinking with Type. But students will be introduced to numerous examples from the history of (predominantly Western) letterforms and concretized language. Understanding these historical forms in their contexts will reveal the logic behind the modern classification of digital type. Students produce weekly type projects which are critiqued and handed in as three project sets. The first set analyses letterforms, structurally and then programmatically. The next project set covers text setting and typographic compositions of increasing semantic and syntactic complexity. The last project is a multilingual, illustrated book layout where students engage the fundamental concept of 'structured variety' over a series of pages..This class is a co-requisite with Beginning Typography and closely couples with the activities of this particular studio course. The lab components will introduce students to page layout software (namely Adobe InDesign), its terminology and its specific functions, its relationship to other software packages, techniques for composing and outputting digitally, and the technical aspects of digital typography. This information will be reinforced via tutorials and short design exercises which target specific topics and techniques covered during lectures. As the semester progresses, this class also functions as a working lab for the Beginning Typography studio class, allowing students to work on the same project across both classes and receive technology assistance from the instructor. This crossover reinforces the links between digital and non-digital composing and terminologies..This course provides an introduction to the UI / UX principles, issues, methods of user-centered responsive web design (mobile, tablet, and laptop). Students hand-code HTML / CSS; and various software to generate Javascript and post fully functioning responsive websites. This course is for students from all departments who may have no previous coding or web design experience. All necessary coding and software skills will be taught in class. Readings focus on Non-Linear User Interaction, and the Relationship between Print and Digital Experiences, with others as necessary. Students should anticipate exercises focusing on the following: usability principles, content organization, strategy, user diagramming, audience analysis. Students will be asked to review and identify both strengths and weaknesses of these concepts across retail, experimental, promotional, and educational websites. There will be one technical study (1 week intensive in hand-coding and XD), and one user-centered project (2 weeks - hand-coding or XD). There are no prerequisites for this course..What does language mean in the visual arts? How do words and images interact in works versus around works? What are the basic skills, methods, and theories of typography, and how might they inform non-design practices? This course is a rigorous and critical, pragmatic, project based exploration of visual representations of text/writing in non-Graphic Design works. The class will seek to frame text and language considerations around its form, and scaffold out from learning in the discipline/s in which students? practices are rooted. Primary course texts will cover fundamentals of typography, and relevant structural aspects of language and writing systems. Works of artists, and designers will also be incorporated to reflect varying student interest on an individual basis. Additionally, the course will also include: Maya Lin?s work, Marti Guixe?s work, Fluxus works, Christian Bok?s work, Tom Phillips? A Humument, Luigi Serafini?s Codex Serafinianus, Xu Bing?s ?square word calligraphy?, the notebook of Shaman Neck, Dom Sylvester Houedard and Concrete Poetry, Teal Triggs? Radical Type Design, Saki Mafundikwa?s Afrikan Alphabets, Timothy Donaldson?s Shapes for Sounds, Scott McCloud?s Understanding Comics, children?s picture books, etc. In the initial two-thirds of the course students can expect to engage in targeted exercises and projects; while the final third will entail students proposing a final project suited to the course but rooted in their own practice and/or objectives..Image Studio is a course that challenges students to interpret, critically read text, conceptualize, and assess project parameters to implement design solutions. The creative process is a core focus throughout the assignments. The goal of this course is to explore the process of creating original imagery and visual information. We utilize digital and analog means to create design solutions to projects that also require fundamental explorations with typography. We explore a diverse means of image construction from paper collage to photography and Photoshop manipulation. Form studies examine design basics such as juxtaposition, repetition, and progression as well as the use of metaphor, analogy, and semiotics. The introduction of design context, audience awareness, and sequential narrative is also addressed..This course provides an introduction to the UI / UX principles, issues, methods of user-centered responsive web design (mobile, tablet, and laptop).

There are no prerequisites for this course..In this course students explore the principles of visual communication by creating two-dimensional printed comprehensive layouts, and three-dimensional mock-ups. Stress is placed on process and development of solutions to problems; idea and form exploration; research; image and text development; compositional structure and hierarchy; verbal, technical, and hand skills. The course also covers the technical aspects of graphic design such as printing methods, papers, and binding. Students will produce 3?4 finished pieces exploring the use of image and type in both single page format, multi-page format, and possibly three-dimensional format. These projects are to be included in the VCD department's obligatory portfolio review for advancement into the VCD intermediate courses..This workshop, appropriate for students working on or off the page, privileges construction by way of collecting, selecting and arranging smaller units I call miniatures. Traditionally miniatures in art have been expected to stand on their own and represent compressed essentials of an accepted form, but this course embraces individual units more slant and rag-tag and explores construction with miniatures that may vary in aspect, scale, intention and material form. This course was created to serve students across the graduate division and works best with an interdisciplinary cohort. All are welcome..Over the course of three weeks, we will examine portraiture in writing, and put our findings into practice by creating a series of portraits and textual sketches which we will share with the group. We will consider the function of voice and description, as well as the agenda, the hagiographical or propagandistic construction, evident in some portraiture. By describing others, we delineate the limits of our own vision..Topics vary by semester. Please see individual topic descriptions.",2
SAIC,Sound,"This course is designed to be a fast-paced first step into the field of 3D CAD modeling, an arena where designers give shape to our daily experience of the world. If this is your first exposure to virtual 3D form development, you will find a flexible interface that facilitates a rapid learning curve from simple to complex. For those with prior CAD experience desiring a more intuitive, less restrictive creative experience, this course will provide the means to turn what you see in your mind and your sketches into exciting visual and precise physically accurate representations of your vision. Initially, the class works through a series of exercises and tutorials designed to bring familiarity and confidence to their experience with Rhino. Students will investigate methods for surfacing, modifying, rendering, and presenting ideas and concepts they create. As each tool and process becomes more familiar, new methods and strategies are introduced, and students are taught how to apply them to create accurate representative models of objects they design. Technical Note Without exception, students are responsible for having a laptop that meets course and software requirements. This course will be taught using the Windows version of Rhino, so a dual-boot template must be installed on Mac laptops prior to the first class by the CRIT Help Desk..Fashion is the perfect gadfly, constructor, and destroyer of worlds. It seems to have no limits. It likes to double up with other arenas of cultural production: it likes to play the field and at the same time be taken seriously. This course will bring together a kaleidoscope of possible couplings: fashion and the body, fashion and fragrance, fashion and performance art, fashion and music, fashion and flowers, fashion and architecture, fashion and film, fashion and power, fashion and identity, fashion and the anthropocene..Freud's psychotherapeutic practice and analytic theory of the complex nature of the human psyche, for instance his 'discovery' of unconscious mental processes, were profoundly influential for a variety of thinkers and practitioners, including Frantz Fanon, and critical theorists of the Frankfurt School such as Theodor W. Adorno. In this course, we read widely from Freud's writings and those he influenced, including the above authors, with attention to the societal implications of Freud's approach to subjectivity..This class primarily explores the 2nd generation Abstract Expressionists; who, unlike the first generation, were mostly representational artists. Yet given that these artists still embraced the spirit and fused the energy of performance aspects of the Abstract Expressionists into their representative images they should not be perceived as being 'reactionary' but as artists bringing Abstract Expressionist movement into its fullest bloom.These artists also are explored with their intimate and artistic involvement with the New York School of Poets and the Contemporary art scene. This class starts with an overview of Abstract Expressionism and then proceeds to explore the 2nd- generation abstractionists Elaine De Kooning, Joan Mitchell and Helen Frankenthaler. Still key to this artistic scene was Fairfield Porter who was seen , by nearly all these artists, as the key central figure for artists as diverse as Wolf Kahn, Jane Freilicher, Nell Blaine and Alex Katz. Therefore an in depth view of Porter's own development especially in relation to his engagement with major 1st generation Abstract artists such as Willem De Kooning is first explored before dealing with the other artists. Given that Fairfield Porter was, besides being a painter a notable art critic. many of his critical views and articles are examined. Besides these reading other major articles concerning each weeks artists are often handed out to be explored in later discussions. There are two major papers ; a mid-term and a final due form each student as well..Incorporating daily visits to the Art Institute of Chicago, this undergraduate and graduate seminar will examine the history of European and American art from the 1870s to the twentieth century through the focused engagement with objects in the museum collections. Class time will be divided between classroom lectures, discussions of daily reading assignments, and museum visits. In all of these, students will be expected to take an active participatory role. Course topics will be determined in relation to the collections on view, but recurring questions will focus on materiality and display.",2

SAIC,Visual Communications,"Fashion Design I builds the skills and talents required to achieve creative fashion. This class teaches the design fundamentals of the integrated core fashion design curriculum. Students will engage multiple skills to create individual, visionary, unconventional garments, and later, collections. Through a series of projects, students explore form, silhouette, volume, and research in design to arrive at a personal point-of-view in fashion. This course will specifically ask students to work conceptually and to develop research methodologies in their design work. Based on this inquiry, students generate sketches and surface treatments to refine their unique silhouettes and material manipulations. No prerequisite..This course develops drawing skills with an emphasis on figure gesture and proportion along with a wide range of media. Students are taught to sketch from a live model while communicating design concepts in clothing with style and expression..This course is an introduction to draping for fashion design and construction. Our focus is on draping blocks, and the creation of slopers; the master patterns of the bodice, skirt, torso, and sleeve from which most designs are developed in flat pattern making..This course introduces students to digital pattern-making for fashion. Students learn to use the CAD hardware and software, designing and modifying patterns virtually. This includes digitizing/converting hard patterns to digital files, modifying existing stock patterns, textile printing, 3-D visualization, and plotting sample patterns. Students receive a hands-on approach to developing virtual patterns through fabric testing, using body measurements, and assembling prototypes for final design approval. Other industry skills are developed, such as creating pattern cards, cutter's musts, grading, and marker making..Selected issues in music and related areas are studied. Topics vary each semester and may include (but are not limited to): musical structure and form, aural literacy, opera studies, music and words, music and the visual arts, history of recorded music, history of the oral tradition, semiotics, communications theory, and others..A film is a composition of moving images and (usually) sounds that constructs a world, a world typically animated or pervaded by some sort of tension or problem. A film can be said to imagine this problem-filled world, to think through it, and to offer it to us, its spectators, to imagine and to think through as well. Often, the worlds and problems imagined in cinema are philosophically rich: they present metaphysical paradoxes, ethical dilemmas, existential conundrums, socio-political impasses, and aesthetic provocations. In such cases, to imagine and think through a cinematic world entails a kind of cross-pollination of philosophy and film, in which we approach film philosophically and philosophy cinematically. In this course we will pursue this bi-directional approach to cinema and philosophy, exploring the ways in which philosophical concepts and arguments clarify and deepen our understanding of films and the ways in which films think through and give a kind of sensuous flesh to philosophical problems. We will read excerpts from four philosophical texts covering topics in film aesthetics, metaphysics, ethics, and political philosophy: Susanne Langers A Note on the Film, Bertrand Russells The Problems of Philosophy, Albert Camuss The Myth of Sisyphus, and Iris Marion Youngs Justice and the Politics of Difference. We will watch ten films drawn from across film history and around the world, including Agns Vardas Clo from 5 to 7, Duncan Joness Source Code, Akira Kurosawas Rashomon, Steve McQueens Mangrove, Lucrecia Martels Zama, Mathieu Kassovitzs Hate, Abbas Kiarostamis Where Is the Friends House?, and Michel Gondrys Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. You will be required to watch most of these movies outside of class, but in two or three instances we will have in-class screenings. Coursework will include short Canvas Discussion Board posts, one in-class presentation, and a final paper..This class provides a basic introduction to the conceptual and quantitative framework necessary to understand the physics of the dynamical world around us. Some questions we address are: What do we need to know to describe motion? How do we model the movement of objects (kinematics)? What makes an object move (interactions, dynamics)? What different ways do we have to think about motion (forces, energy)? Reviewing skills in algebra as we go, we cover Newton's laws of motion and the analysis of physical systems in terms of forces and energy. We study the motion of objects on surfaces and those moving through the air. We take an introductory look at the forces of gravity and surface forces like friction and the so-called normal force. Some time will be spent studying the lack of motion, or static equilibrium. Laboratory and problem solving explorations help us develop important physical concepts and scientific reasoning skills. Applications are drawn from everyday phenomena as well as topics in architecture and design. Assignments include weekly homework, in-class problem solving and lab activities, two to three exams, and a short final project on a topic of the student's choosing..The oceans and the animals that dwell there are a key resource to planet earth, providing food, medicine, the bases for sacred cultural customs, and much more. However, they are in trouble. This course is a survey of marine ecosystems and the organisms that make them up from diatoms and dinaflagellates, to seahorses and great white sharks. We will discuss the abysmal forecast for the future of the planetary sea and how we can change the outcome now..This course is an introduction to the principles of ecology, emphasizing detailed field investigations of natural communities. Natural History studies allow for many aspects of knowledge to be applied to the understanding of a Biological concept. Among the topics explored are the dynamics of lake ecosystems, forest succession, trophic structure in streams, dune ecology, and territorial behavior in breeding birds and mammals. Lecture/Discussions examine major themes in modern ecology, including energy flow, nutrient cycling, and species diversity. Selections from nineteenth- and twentieth-century American naturalists (Thoreau, Muir, Burroughs, and Leopold) provide perspective on the relationship of humanity to nature. Global warming and pollution dynamics are explored. Lab activities at the Field Museum of Natural History, Lincoln Park Zoo, and the Shedd Aquarium strengthen the understanding of these concepts..Gender theory is mobilized in feminist activism toward a variety of goals. This course will offer a survey of social theories of gender and will proceed to identify them as the foundations and justifications of social movements in each wave of feminism. Theories include de Beauvoir, Crenshaw, Rubin, Schilt, and Butler. Social movements will include suffragettes, NOW, the Combahee River Collective, riot grrrl, Sisters in Islam, and transgender social movements..This is a class in intensive and immersive making and curating. Students may complete rough cuts or refined versions of whole books, films, performances & installations or may begin prototypes/push toward final work for single or series of paintings, sculptures, photographs, prints. Some may choose to engage new paths while others may curate or re-version aspects of previous work in new form or mode. The content of the class is each student?s work & practice. The compressed time frame, single focus and opportunity to produce and share work in an atmosphere of values-based critique provides both art & artist equally compressed & focused awareness of emerging pressure points on each work's or practice's trajectories. In a framework intensely engaging and intensely collegial we mean to recognize and name particulars of both our present work and emergent futures. Each student offers first an overview of practice followed by three separate iterations or progressions of work. The intense work load simultaneously demands and supports lightning-fast leaps in accomplishment, with weekly presentation of work forcing both intuitive & considered aesthetic choices, launching exciting new paths..This is ae credit study trip placeholder course.

SAIC,Writing,"Living the Past in the Present.This course plunges students into content and ideas that universities often leave until graduate school, as we consider the role played by the 'critical' in 'visual and critical studies.' For the past ten years, it has been referred to as 'a primer for the art world.' It will still, mostly, provide you with a working vocabulary and crash course as to bodies of knowledge integral to the study of visual culture. At the same time, to productively engage in a reflective critique of society and culture, it will consider 'texts' from as diverse and contemporaneous a group of scholars, theorists, critics, and cultural producers as possible, from both inside and outside the academic institution..This interdisciplinary critique seminar is designed to help students recognize patterns of inquiry within their studio work while proceeding toward an outward-facing practice beyond graduation. An assessment of previous projects will be the starting point for an ongoing critical examination of your creative practice, through which you will be asked to contextualize and position your work in the art-worlds of the 21st Century. This course is a forum for in-depth individual and group critiques with technical and conceptual discussions tailored to your practice and research. In addition to various readings, screenings, and field trips, class visits by local artists and curators will provide the opportunity for conversation about the lived experience of sustaining a creative practice. With an emphasis on faculty mentorship, class meetings will support the development of a focused, self-initiated Senior Project, a strong portfolio, and the tools for maintaining an independent studio practice..In this course, students will explore and create their own definitions of success, starting with their preconceived notions of what it means to be a successful artist. We will break down outdated expectations and myths and will rebuild unique, personal, and fulfilling plans for a creative life. Through writing, mentoring, and research students will explore career paths and what it means to live the flexible and nuanced life of an artist. We will investigate a number of topics and tools that support a career in the arts, including: mind-mapping, goal-setting, creating professional materials (CV, statement, bio), applying to professional opportunities such as grants and residencies, studio visits, and working with galleries. Course material will include artists personal accounts of leading a creative life and tools they use to make projects more rich. This course involves numerous written assignments; students must be prepared to write and edit their work. Students will choose from a vast menu of short projects in order to tailor their experience in the class to their career goals. Final assignments will include 1) a clear personal vision of success; 2) steps for achieving short and long-term goals, and 3) refined professional materials suitable for application.",2

Professional opportunities: BA&LLB graduates use their degree to move into a range of careers.  These include all of the traditional legal pathways – solicitors, barristers, etc. – but also an additional range of possibilities opened up by the training in Arts and Literary Studies made available by this unique degree. What You’ll Study: The programme fosters valuable skills in both legal argumentation and literary analysis. As a Literary Studies major, BA&LLB students can choose their course of study in the Faculty of Arts from a wide array of subjects in English literature, Chinese literature, comparative literature, language and communication, linguistics, translation studies, and many others. In the Faculty of Law, students take foundational courses in legal studies as well as upper-level electives that allow them to explore their interests in greater depth. In addition to studying individual subjects in both faculties, students in this programme take interdisciplinary seminars which bring together legal and literary texts – an opportunity to deepen and broaden both legal knowledge and critical analysis skills. Currently offered in the programme are subjects examining law and film; medieval law and literature; law, meaning and interpretation; contemporary law and literary texts; legal history; and many more. Exciting Opportunities: Students successfully entering this programme will be part of a small cohort, with whom they will take the core subjects in the programme.  They also participate fully in the opportunities offered by both the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Law – including university clubs and societies, international exchange, internships, experiential learning, and other programmes.  In addition, students in the BA&LLB programme have access to tailored internship and research opportunities in their final year, available only within the programme.Professional Recognition: To practise law in Hong Kong, LLB graduates must pass the Postgraduate Certificate in Laws (PCLL).  The Department of Professional Legal Education of the Faculty of Law at HKU offers a one-year full-time or two-year part-time certificate course.  Admission is open to law graduates from HKU and other approved universities and institutions in Hong Kong.
