# Bi-directional Job-Program Recommendation System

## Introduction and Purpose

This project introduces a novel approach to bridge the gap between job requirements and educational program descriptions using advanced keyword extraction and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Through our system, users can obtain job recommendations based on course descriptions and vice versa.

## Key Features and Functions

- **Keyword Extraction**: Analyzes and presents the most pertinent keywords from job descriptions and course content.
- **Dashboard Visualization**: A user-friendly dashboard built with Streamlit to showcase the functionality of keyword extraction and the results of recommendations.
- **Bi-directional Recommendations**: Users can not only find matching jobs for a given course but also identify educational courses that align with specific job requirements.
